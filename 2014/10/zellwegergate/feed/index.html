		<description><![CDATA[Yes this whole scrutinizing of her looks is awful and way beyond unkind but the fact is that even though none of us know her personally togave an opinion on her personal life choices, , we all developed a relationship with her as an actress, by loving her and her image in all her wonderful roles, and it&#039;s completely understandable that we are in shock from seeing her looking absolutely unrecognazible.

		<description><![CDATA[Exactly! It is about time someone appreciates her change instead of criticising it. Whether she is lying and did have botox or did everything all naturally, she&#039;ll have still gone through some pain to get to the stage she is at, so well done her. I  want whatever she is having as she looks fab!]]></description>
