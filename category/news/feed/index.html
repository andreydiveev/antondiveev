				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fashion and the female body to many have been as natural a pairing as Karl Lagerfeld and Chanel or Levi Roots and barbeque sauce but the recent scandal that has erupted around controversial photographer Terry Richardson has added a fresh perspective to fashion&#8217;s fascination with the female body. This is why you should check out <em>Posturing: Photographing the Body in Fashion </em>before it closes in London on 12 November.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18147" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/11/Posturing_06.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/11/Posturing_06.jpg 1000w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/11/Posturing_06-500x334.jpg 500w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/11/Posturing_06-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/11/Posturing_06-750x500.jpg 750w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/11/Posturing_06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The female body is the blueprint for everything from the designer envisioning the collection to sexualised and depicted glamour shoots you see spread across billboards and fashion magazines. A group of photographers have and come together challenge this notion and explore the role of the female body in contemporary fashion photography. Exhibition curators Holly Hay, Art Buyer at Dazed Media Studio, and Shonagh Marshall, curator of numerous Somerset House exhibitions, have linked up with luxury online retailer THE OUTNET.COM on a three-part tour of the exhibition that started in London.</p>
<div id="attachment_18148" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-18148" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/11/BriannaCapozzi.jpeg" alt="Photograph by Brianna Capozzi, ‘Laura Ashley’ from Double Magazine, Autumn/Winter 2016." width="1000" height="1504" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/11/BriannaCapozzi.jpeg 1000w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/11/BriannaCapozzi-332x500.jpeg 332w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/11/BriannaCapozzi-768x1155.jpeg 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/11/BriannaCapozzi-499x750.jpeg 499w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/11/BriannaCapozzi-600x902.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Photograph by Brianna Capozzi, ‘Laura Ashley’ from Double Magazine, Autumn/Winter 2016.</p></div>
<p>Images were collated from 2010 until now from celebrated photographers such as Charlie Engman, Johnny Dufort, Marton Perlaki, LCF alumna Coco Capitan and Zoe Ghertner amongst others will be on display alongside seminal. The exhibition uses the images to chart a movement in which the body is captured in extraordinary gestures and poses, tracing a new aesthetic in fashion photography over seven years ago and continues to develop today.</p>

<p>If the industry wants to move forward from the depiction of the female body, it needs to look at the female body through a different lens, which is exactly what this exhibition sets out to intend. So head down before it closes next Sunday 12 November, otherwise, you&#8217;ll have to catch it in December with a film, shown at Art Basel in Miami Beach, and will conclude with a book, <em>Posturing: Writing the Body</em> i<em>n Fashion</em> released in March next year.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Posturing: Photographing the Body in Fashion is on at 10, Thurloe Place, SW7, from November 2nd to November 12th</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1981, a young Anita Corbin took 28 double portraits of young women from different cultural groups. She documented skins, mods, punks, rockabillies, new romantics, rastas and young lesbians at the beginning of her career. She was fascinated by the ways in which cultural allegiance and identity were boldly and explicitly expressed through fashion, music and environment by women emerging from adolescence. Anita was recently commissioned to take these images around the country for her travelling exhibition, <a href="http://visiblegirls.com/">Visible Girls: Revisited</a>.</span></p>

<p class="p1">The exhibition brings together original images of women from different subcultures of the early 1980s and newly commissioned portraits of the same women now. Her work reveals and reflects upon identity and society at various stages of women&#8217;s lives. The images act as <span class="s1">a rarity for the time, not only because of their subjects but because of the photographer&#8217;s technical approach using slow colour film and portable flash.</span></p>
<h1 class="p1" style="text-align: center"><a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/visible-girls-revisited-exhibition-and-uk-tour-film-photography#/">Want to support the exhibition? Find out how to fund the tour.</a></h1>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anita spoke about her work and exhibition recently. She said, &#8220;This exhibition is not only about the powerful bond between women united by subculture, belief and friendship, but about the potential of women coming together across generations. <em>Visible Girls: Revisited</em>, allows the ‘visibility’ of youth to shine a light on the often-disregarded wisdom of the older woman, revealing a unique, cross-generational tribe with the power to provoke and inspire. <em>Visible Girls: Revisited</em> is an exhibition where mothers and daughters will find mutually provocative ground through which to forge a rare solidarity &#8211; that at this point in our history we need more than ever.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1">Last year Corbin launched an international social media campaign in order to track the women down. Now, 36 years later and with over 70% of the women found, the original images of those young women will be displayed alongside a new series &#8211; of the women they became.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The 56 women who feature in the images were mainly from London but some were on a day trip or on holiday in the city when Corbin photographed them, many are now living in Europe or further afield. The exhibition will tour England &#8211; each location will have a unique presentation inspired by the voice of the city.</span><span class="s4"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">The exhibition explores the<span class="s1"> individual stories behind each image, seeing how the women&#8217;s lives have changed since the original shot was taken. What has happened in those 36 years? Have their lives developed as they imagined? How have changes in society and its attitudes to women affected them?</span></p>

<p class="p1">Do you know any of these Visible Girls? The search continues for the remaining 30% of the missing subjects &#8211; join us on social media and help us find them <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=visiblegirls&amp;src=typd"><span class="s3">#VisibleGirls</span></a>.<span class="s1">  </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Museum of Transology exhibition has been on display at LCF&#8217;s <a href="http://www.fashionspacegallery.com/">Fashion Space Gallery</a> for the past few months and it closes on April 22, so now is your last chance to go and check it out. The exhibition hosts the largest collection of trans artefacts and photographs ever to be displayed in the UK, and shows the many realities of modern trans life, whilst also posing a bigger question about the omission of trans lives from larger national museum collections.</p>

<p>After Fashion Space Gallery, the exhibition will be on display in Brighton Museum, from July 2017 until summer 2018. In an <a href="http://bit.ly/2pbwpp3">interview with LCF News</a>, the curator of the exhibition E-J Scott said:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the most wonderful things for me has been that at the end of the exhibition, there’s a hat rack coming out of the wall where everyone can leave a message, and it’s heaving with tags from people writing comments. What’s interesting is that it’s clear that it has become an exhibition that’s about more than trans, it’s about gender and about how gender roles affect everyone’s lives. It’s been hitting people personally whether they are trans or not, and for me that’s very interesting.</p></blockquote>
<p>He spoke about how the exhibition will be expanded at Brighton:</p>
<blockquote><p>There’s going to be new sections when it goes there – the way the the exhibition is formed at the moment, is that we tackled major issues affecting trans communities. In the new exhibition, the crux of the show will be the same, but we will have add on sections, and we will also engage with the permanent collection at the Brighton museum too, and explore the way objects within this, can represent people’s non normative gender experiences. We’ll hopefully use some items out of the costume collection for example, and look at fashion and gender. It’s going to be bigger, bolder and tackle new issues.</p></blockquote>
<p>The exhibition is on at Fashion Space Gallery until 22 April. It opens to the public at Brighton Museum on 20 July. You can follow Museum of Transology on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MuseumofTransology/">Facebook </a>and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/museumoftransology/">Instagram</a>.</p>

<p>In a London-based studio, dancers mimic the expressive forms of war monuments of the former Yugoslavia. Devised and shot by Jovana Mladenovic, her medium format camera captures an eerie dynamism between static forms and moving bodies, touching on fashion, dance, photography and history to bring lesser known histories to light.</p>
<p>Contemporary Balkan Art presents this work as part of “Interruption<em>,“ </em>amassing forty works by seventeen contemporary Balkan artists. Jovana will be speaking about her work as part of the event “Artist in Conversation” by CoBA, on 25th of April.</p>
<p><a href="http://contemporarybalkanart.com/interruption/">Interruption</a> opened April 6th, at Library, St Martin’s Lane, and runs until 11th May 2017.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Imagine a world where fashion is fair.&#8221; That is the rallying cry from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/isusseditout/">SUSS UK</a> founders Emma Grace Bailey and Abigail Grainger.  UAL almuna, the journalist and fashion designer respectively have launched a Kickstarter to fund their upcoming pop-up concept store which will promote a sustainable lifestyle with ethical, environmentally and human friendly brands.  The store will also raise awareness around the issues of sustainability in the fashion industry and provide insight into the problems fast fashion causes, and provide solutions to the problem.</p>
<div id="attachment_16727" style="width: 582px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-16727" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/03/kickstarter-poster-fashion-with-a-conscience-572x750.jpg" alt="SUSS UK Kickstarter flyer " width="572" height="750" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/03/kickstarter-poster-fashion-with-a-conscience-572x750.jpg 572w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/03/kickstarter-poster-fashion-with-a-conscience-381x500.jpg 381w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/03/kickstarter-poster-fashion-with-a-conscience-600x787.jpg 600w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/03/kickstarter-poster-fashion-with-a-conscience.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">SUSS UK Kickstarter flyer</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what spurred Abi and Emma to take action? Well they are concerned about the irreversible damage being caused by our excessive levels of consumption. Over the last five years, the fast<br />
fashion industry has grown exponentially, with the top five retailers growing 9.7 per cent year on year. Brands churn out an average of 52 micro collections a year, and with higher production<br />
levels comes higher consumption, resulting in a quantity of waste that the planet can no longer deal with. In just one year, the clothes discarded in the UK alone could fill Wembley stadium, the equivalent of 1.5 million tonnes of landfill every 365 days.</p>
<p>Sustainability is not a trend. It is a necessary step which the fashion industry must take for the future of our planet. At present, both the industry and the consumer are moving too slowly, but there are a growing number of brands who are paving the way with innovative solutions to material waste, supply chains, production and sourcing. Supported by a growing number of consumers who are becoming more conscious and looking at their options.</p>
<p>SUSS UK is dedicated to further raising this awareness, and firmly believe that the secretive nature of the fashion industry needs to stop. All consumers deserve to know exactly what they’re<br />
buying. But this is not about preaching. SUSS UK love fashion, they just want fashion to be kind as well as beautiful.</p>
<p>The first of its kind store will run throughout September 2017 and stock global womenswear, menswear, kidswear, homeware, beauty and food &amp; drink brand. SUSS UK will show that sustainabilty is an entire lifestyle not just a fad. There will also be a series of talks with industry heavyweights giving insight into their sustainable life and interactive workshops giving consumers a hands-on experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/721490866/fashion-with-a-conscience?ref=project_link">SUSS UK need to raise £10,000 by 1st May 2017</a> and are looking for donors. Get involved and support this worthy initiative.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>DelvesintoHollis</em>, the multi disciplinary arts collective supporting emerging talent is calling for applications for their next exhibition <em>BOUNDARIES </em>which runs from 7th-10th April 2017.  Established by LCF alum Becky Hollis and school friend Caitlin Delves who graduated from Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art &amp; Design, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/delvesintohollis/"><em>DelvesintoHollis </em></a>hope to create a platform for artists to come together. Fashion, Fine Art, Sculpture, Photography, Theatre, Dance, Installation, Print, Film, Spoken word&#8230; this is a great opportunity for you to showcase your work.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-16119" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/12/BOUNDARIES-IMAGE-2-470x343.jpg" alt="boundaries-image-2" width="470" height="343" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/12/BOUNDARIES-IMAGE-2-470x343.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/12/BOUNDARIES-IMAGE-2-310x226.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/12/BOUNDARIES-IMAGE-2.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-16120" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/12/BOUNDARIES-IMAGE-6-470x290.jpg" alt="boundaries-image-6" width="470" height="290" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/12/BOUNDARIES-IMAGE-6-470x290.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/12/BOUNDARIES-IMAGE-6-310x191.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/12/BOUNDARIES-IMAGE-6.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/delvestohollis"><i>BOUNDARIES</i></a> will explore the concrete, abstract, tangible and intangible boundaries within society, work, space and artistic practice. The exhibition will simultaneously interrogate and celebrate our understanding through both form and content. The artists will be encouraged to traverse boundaries within their practice and the content of their work. The exhibition will play with the boundaries that exist between creator and spectator, inviting audiences into the work on a whole new level.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-16121" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/12/BOUNDARIES-IMAGE-4-470x343.jpg" alt="boundaries-image-4" width="470" height="343" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/12/BOUNDARIES-IMAGE-4-470x343.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/12/BOUNDARIES-IMAGE-4-310x226.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/12/BOUNDARIES-IMAGE-4.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Around 8 artists will be selected exhibit their work in response to the theme of boundaries. Additionally, each artist will be asked to create a secondary piece inspired by another exhibiting artists work. In doing so <a href="https://www.facebook.com/delvesintohollis/"><em>DelvesintoHollis</em> </a>hope to not only create a dialogue between each artist, but also the selected works on display.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The selected artists will present their work in an individual “pod”. The open-walled pods will all be the same shape and size, but may be uniquely used to suit an artist’s personal exhibitory needs. The uniform yet flexible space within a space will blur the boundaries between the individual and the collective. The exhibition will thereby serve the needs of each individual artist whilst creating the sense of a whole.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>BOUNDARIES</em> runs from 7th-10th April 2017 and will take place at <a href="http://www.danceforall.co.uk/" target="_blank">Dance for All</a> and is supported by <a href="http://www.etchtheatre.com/" target="_blank">Etch Theatre Company</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Applications are open until 11.59pm January 8th 2017.  For more information and to apply visit <a href="https://www.delvesintohollis.com/submission-form/">DevlvesintoHollis</a>&#8216; website.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In 1985, The Sun newspaper printed the following joke: “Mom, I’ve got good news and bad news. The bad news is I’m gay. The good news is I’m dying.” By then, the AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) epidemic and hysteria was full blown with 20,303 cases globally. The virus, which had claimed a few sporadic cases in the 70s, had aggressively manifested into a worldwide terror, nicknamed by the media as ‘ gay cancer’ and preached as the Lord’s comeuppance on a sinful homosexual community. Thankfully, we have come along way since then. </em></p>

<p><strong>Why is it that 1 in every 20 gay and bisexual men in the UK is living with HIV and the numbers are increasing?</strong></p>
<p>Medical research into HIV and AIDS is at its most advanced, with continual breakthroughs in prevention and treatment and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) has become a lifelong illness rather than an immediate death sentence. As yet, there is no cure for HIV or AIDS.The older generation lived through the AIDS epidemic and came out the other side, fully aware of what the virus can do. They survived the despite the lack of information and awareness. We are lucky, now, to have all the information that we need at our fingertips. So why is it that 1 in every 20 gay and bisexual men in the UK is living with HIV and the numbers are increasing? 1 in 5 of this number is currently unaware of his HIV+ status. In London, 1 in every 11 gay and bisexual men is HIV+. Men who have sex with men represent almost 55% of those diagnosed with HIV. Rates continue to rise while behaviours remain unchanged and attitudes seem to show complacency.</p>
<p>In London, mayor Sadiq Khan spoke in early 2016 about the dangers of a relaxed attitude towards HIV after statistics revealed a disproportionate number of Londoners living with the virus. In 2014, London accounted for 45% of the total HIV diagnoses in England, with 30 out of 32 London boroughs showing a higher than average HIV rate. Speaking to gay publication <a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/01/11/sadiq-khan-londons-record-on-lgbt-hate-crime-is-a-badge-of-shame/">PinkNews</a>, Khan said: “<em>These statistics show a huge rise in the prevalence of HIV+ in London, and behind each of these statistics is a story of human suffering and sadness. While treatment for HIV sufferers has improved rapidly over my lifetime, we can’ t afford to be complacent about HIV prevention.”</em></p>
<p>Speaking of the rise of diagnosed cases,<a href="https://twitter.com/DoctorChrisVT?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"> Dr Chris van Tulleken</a>, a virologist at UCL, who is behind the BBC documentary The Truth About HIV, accredits increased testing and available facilities for the growth in figures but also a “decrease in awareness in many communities. There is now a generation of sexually active men and women who did not grow up with HIV as a death sentence and so they’re less concerned, take fewer precautions and end up more at risk.”</p>
<p><strong>Prevention rather than cure</strong></p>
<p>PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) is a daily pill which greatly reduces the person’ s risk of HIV infection. It contains two medicines that are used in HIV treatment, so if a user is exposed to HIV, these medicines work to combat the virus and prevent infection. PrEP is offered to HIV- people whose behaviour puts them at risk of HIV or someone who is in a relationship with an HIV+ person. PrEP users must commit to seeing their health care provider every three months for a check up. The drug has been shown to reduce the risk of HIV infection in people at high risk by up to 90% and is currently in use in countries such as France, Australia, Canada and the US.</p>
<p>Dr van Tulleken supports the availability of the drug. “PrEP is great. It makes total economic and medical sense. It prevents spread and diminishes the risk of resistant virus emerging. It reeks of homophobia that it is taking so long to make it widely available.”And it is taking far too long. With all the potential offered in PrEP in stamping out HIV, it is wonder that in May 2016, NHS England voted against offering the drug. The decision however has been successfully challenged in court by the<a href="http://www.nat.org.uk/"> National AIDS Trust</a>.</p>
<p>In a bid to further prevent the rate of infection, there are calls for dating apps to provide sexual health advice and offer free condoms to their users. There is no evidence directly linking dating apps to increased HIV rates, however they are a factor which must be considered. The globally popular gay app Grindr is encouraging its one million plus active users across 192 countries to get tested and provides information about local testing centres.</p>
<p>LCF alum Jacob Alexander was diagnosed with HIV on his 22nd birthday. Speaking at a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOVRVcOk_H4&amp;index=11&amp;list=PLsRNoUx8w3rN_pD7pf1fEzVFlG3Fga9cU">TEDxUAL</a> event in 2016, the creative direction student shared his personal story. Inspired by his own journey with the virus and its stigma, Alexander launched<a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/the-positive-project-how-a-new-app-aims-to-change-our-attitude-towards-hiv-a3267321.html"> The Positive Project</a>, an app geared to build awareness around the causes and symptoms of HIV. Its users are given HIV facts, health information and directed to local treatment centres, while also building a global community of mutual support.</p>
<p>Though prevention is obviously better than cure, if one is exposed to HIV there is PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis). It is an emergency measure which combines powerful drugs to combat the virus once it is in the body, and must be taken with the first 72 hours after infection. PEP is not a ‘morning after pill’ for HIV – it is a last resort, with unpleasant side effects.</p>
<p><strong>Obstacles to overcome</strong></p>
<p>While the fear of the 80s epidemic has subsided, the stigma surrounding the virus remains strong. In May 2016, Austrian-based magazine <em>Vangardist</em> printed a special edition of its magazine using ink infused with HIV+ blood, with the hopes of raising discussion about the virus and reducing the discrimination. Apps such as Alexander’ s work to reduce stigma as well as do initiatives from organisations such as National AIDS Trust and Terrence Higgins Trust. <a href="http://www.tht.org.uk/our-charity/Our-work/What-we-do/National-HIV-testing-week">National HIV Testing Week</a> is an annual campaign which encourages people to get tested. It is free and gives an instant diagnosis. In July 2016, Prince Harry publicly took an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuGKDLycQT0">HIV test</a>.  “Whether you’re a man, woman, gay, straight, black, white, whatever – even gingers! – why wouldn’t you come and have a test?” said the royal.</p>
<p>Although we have access to the internet, where we can find out as much as possible about any subject, it still relies on a person actively seeking out the information. To be informed about something like HIV, you have to search. Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988 prohibited local authorities, such as schools and councils, from promoting or educating about homosexual lifestyle. Though it was repealed in 2000, sex education in schools remains primarily on heterosexual relationships, ignoring LGBT education. This includes issues such as HIV.</p>
<p>While van Tulleken agrees that education is vital when it comes to HIV, he also appreciates that sexual behaviours are more emotionally charged than intellectually grounded and that is something which must be worked on. “Intellectual knowledge is of less use in decision making about sexual health than more experiential and emotional knowledge. The academic knowledge that it will be more difficult living with HIV than not feels less tangible when at the decision-making moment when possibly drunk and probably horny.”</p>
<p>When it comes to HIV – or any other sexually transmitted infection – van Tulleken suggests that the best view to take is that “anyone with a sex life is at risk. When you have sex, you inherit the sexual history of everyone your partner has slept with too. That casts the net pretty wide and most of us are bad at having the conversation about who our exes have slept with and how.”When it comes to HIV, we live in an age where we have access to all the information we need and access to methods of prevention, and yet the rates of infection continue to rise. We enjoy sexual liberation and open social attitudes, but with that freedom comes responsibility – to others and to ourselves. Education, protection and prevention are the foundations of a future generation that can live without the fear of HIV and AIDS.</p>
