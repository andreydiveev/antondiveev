				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Behind Vetements’ £400 oversize hoodies and four </i></span><i style="line-height: 1.5">figure chopped jeans is <i style="line-height: 1.5">Demna and Guram Gvasalia</i> &#8211; two brothers from Georgia, with a business model that has seen them rise to the top of the industry in just under two years. Now they&#8217;re ready to revolutionise the system and want you all to come along for the ride.</i></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15985" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/03/MG_2984.jpg" alt="_MG_2984" width="1326" height="775" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/03/MG_2984.jpg 1326w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/03/MG_2984-310x181.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/03/MG_2984-768x449.jpg 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/03/MG_2984-470x275.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/03/MG_2984-600x351.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1326px) 100vw, 1326px" /></p>
<p>It is not a groundbreaking business model, but it is one built on steady foundations, depicted as a simple but structurally sound Roman temple by Guram Gvasalia &#8211; the CEO &#8211; at his talk ‘Collective Action’ hosted by London College of Fashion.</p>
<p>Guram is the business side of the partnership, the numbers man, while his brother Demna brings concept and design to the brand. Guram has an arguably less glamorous role but it was his experience in business and Vetements&#8217; business model that host Sarah Mower wanted to tackle and share with the audience of students from London’s top fashion institutions. “We’re here to talk fashion business, the fundamentals of the fashion industry and how they should change for the future, for your futures.”</p>
<p>Mower went on to discuss the state of the industry at a point where access to information has never been so easy or so fast, where celebrity endorsement sells shoes and our attention spans are dropping. “We’re seeing unprecedented chaos in the industry. Hysteria over ‘see now buy now’, the insane pace of fashion and the impact of social media.”</p>
<p>Vetements have spun controversy and success in equal measure, recently announcing that they would merge their men’s and women’s show into one, and move it to coincide with the pre-collections schedule of January and June. “Doing one show is more cost effective. Also doing one show is closer to reality, boys and girls together. The people these days they can choose their own gender. The clothes have the gender.”</p>
<p>We’re unearthing their success. This is Vetements by numbers&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Harness the right side of your brain</strong><br />
Fashion is not built on creativity and fun alone. Guram studied at top business schools in Law and business in Germany before moving to London to study Fashion Marketing at London College of Fashion. His intense education in business and his German upbringing has made him level headed, good with numbers and organised &#8211; “when I moved to Paris I realised how organised German culture makes you without even realising.”</p>
<p><strong>2. Keep it real</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fashion tries to sell a dream rather than reality.&#8221; says Guram, and </span></strong>Vetements sells reality, he continues. Arguably an expensive kind of reality, one built on clothes that are imperfect and playful and catwalk shows (intimate and one row only) where the clothes are modelled by mates.</p>
<p><strong>3. Work with good stores</strong><br />
“It was a lot of calling, a lot of rejection.” Gvasalia says of trying to secure stores at the beginning. a Personal phone call &#8211; he and Demna made nearly 500 &#8211; is his advice. “It&#8217;s not about the quantity of stores. It&#8217;s about the quality of the stores you’re working with and at a certain point their budgets.”</p>
<p><strong>4. You need manufacturers you can trust</strong></p>
<p>Vetements take a hardline when it comes to working with manufacturers. Work on a contract basis and with a lawyer you can trust. Manufacturers have to pay penalties if they don’t deliver.</p>
<p><strong>5. Demand 30% prepayment, 30% before delivery</strong><br />
“Getting the money from stores afterwards is very difficult. Thirty percent is not a lot of money but it&#8217;s an [important] commitment. If people refuse to give you the thirty percent it means there is something dodgy going on and you need to be careful.” And pay your manufacturers early or on time in return.</p>
<p><strong>6. Work with family, create family</strong><br />
Matches and Ssense are good examples of brands built on marriages, sibling partnerships, and that produce stronger families around them. Guram said “The problem with big structures is the buyers change so frequently, there is no consistency.” During delivery time at the Vetements he said ‘everyone from the design team comes to the warehouse, everyone from the commercial team comes to the warehouse and we pack all together… People from design team go to the showroom and actually sells, because they have a different story to tell.”</p>
<p><strong>7. Get, or be, a good Product and Production Manager</strong><br />
This is the most important and difficult role to fill in a company. Guram says “Italian [speaking] is a bonus. They&#8217;re difficult to find and get paid three or five times more than designers.”</p>
<p><strong>8. Be careful with distributors or do your own sales</strong><br />
Working with bad distributors can lead to your brand being stocked in ‘horrible stores’. “I was in Japan and was buying a bento box in a store. And I said to the person working there “it looks like a fake Margiela bag” then I realised it was a real one and it stocked a huge amount of Margiela.”</p>
<p><strong>9. Cap quantities</strong><br />
“Luxury was always something that was scarce.” said Guram. Nowadays luxury is mass produced in China. Vestments returns to more traditional notions of luxury, producing limited edition runs. “When the items are sold out they&#8217;re sold out.” Guram said. “We have thousands of requests for the hoodies. If we did them again we could sell a million in a day but we don’t and it&#8217;s out of respect for the people that got the hoodies, who can cherish the hoodies.”</p>
<p><strong>10. Don’t just follow suit</strong><br />
Guram admitted that “The Industry needs to change.” Production to delivery times are not realistic within the current fashion calendar. Do what you can cope with, rather than conforming to the systems in place. And although Guram backtracked on the inta ‘see now, buy now’ model, which he had spoken out about in the press before, he believed in finding ways to move forward. “There is an amazing person who created all these rules Pierre Bergé, and I respect him a lot and it was fifty years ago, and since him no one has come and said “look you know let&#8217;s update the industry.” We’re in 2016 and probably we need to have modern ways of doing things.”</p>
<p>“Start speaking out about things. Because once you’ve become part of the corporate structure you forget about these things. So while you are still free from the people telling you what to do you can build your own opinions &#8211; about what is the right thing and what is the wrong thing. Ask why do we need to play a game that doesn’t make sense.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An iconic fashion moment is completely unique, emotional and gone in an instant; as is the nature of the industry. And it is on the catwalk – a place that is both temporary and memorable &#8211; where these moments are made. Who could forget the Naomi Campbell platform trip, Margiela’s mechanically spray-painted models or Kate Moss’s turn for Galliano, emblazoned in a Union Jack motif?</p>
<p>Fashion’s Front Line, the new book (published by Bloomsbury Visual) documents the work of catwalk photographer Niall McInerney with words by <a href="http://www.arts.ac.uk/fashion/">London College of Fashion</a>’s <a href="http://www.arts.ac.uk/fashion/courses/graduate-school/ma-fashion-media-production/http://www.arts.ac.uk/fashion/courses/graduate-school/ma-fashion-media-production/">MA Fashion Media Production</a> Course Leader <a href="http://www.arts.ac.uk/fashion/people/teaching-staff/nilgin-yusuf/">Nilgin Yusuf</a>. Recording nearly three decades of Niall’s runway and backstage photography, this tome captures those moments but also the zeitgeist.</p>
<p>At an <a href="http://www.arts.ac.uk/fashion/events-open-days/inside-the-industry-series/">LCF Inside the Industry</a> discussion about the book, Niall shared some of those images with the audience, commissioned by the likes of Harpers and Newsweek, accompanied by quips and quick wit. McInerney’s jump from photographing strippers in Soho to runway photographer is unsurprising – there is theatre in both subjects. Naomi’s stumble was one of Niall’s bestselling images because who could resist a bit of real drama. Working with Kodachrome film, which he says produces very extreme colours and heightened tones, McInerney began shooting his friends’ degree shows and clothing lines, including John Galliano’s pirate-esque Central Saint Martins degree show. And so he fell camera first, into the frenetic world of fashion.</p>

<p>Niall began his journey into photography in a pre-digital world. Precision was integral to his job and a lack of it could cost him expensive film and the chance to capture something wonderful but fleeting. But analogue footage also brings character and romance – the odd scratch here, smear there, a fuzz reflecting the heat of a thousand cameras. There are imperfections in McInerney’s images – blurs and saturation – but he is adamant that this is where reality lies. Nilgin, a former Fashion Journalist and now Programme leader at LCF, acknowledges in her introduction to the book that ‘Fashion is change, and that change is reflected not only in the evolution of seasonally paraded cut, colour, and cloth but also in the way these garments are packaged, presented, and recorded.’ Livestreaming, social media and digital photography have changed the face of runway photography. This book starkly highlights that transition, while celebrating what we&#8217;ve learnt and where we&#8217;re going.</p>
<p>From identifying aesthetics like minimalism, to depicting the rise of The Supermodels and fashion’s front row, the book covers bigger moments and trends in fashion the fleeting ones &#8211; Issey Miyake’s presentation in the Paris Metro. It is interspersed with eye witness reports from industry insiders including Model Agent Sarah Doukas, Hair Stylist Sam McKnight and fellow photographers.</p>
<p>In a selfie-saturated world, we expect to be admitted into moments of intimacy and take for granted mediums like backstage photography. Often, those backstage shots are sterile and perfect, used to capture the latest beauty trend. But, the behind the scenes-before-the-show-imagery used to be something else entirely &#8211; a phenomenon that was pioneered by McInerney and his peers in a bid to record interesting moments that they didn’t get from the crowded runway show. An article in the Telegraph said “Niall was also one of the first to see the possibilities of backstage photography, and of documenting the guests and party crashers at the shows, entertaining all with his dotty Irish spiel.”</p>
<p>It is that character and sharp wit, very much still present aged 74, that has gained him entry with no tickets, charmed models into posing and stopped editors in their tracks for one-time photos. From the occasional shot of him napping on train platforms surrounded by kit, it is clear that patience and humour were necessary to survive as a catwalk photographer. Long hours, sitting around, lugging equipment and being crammed in a pit is a far cry from the life of a top fashion editor. In Niall’s own words, the position was seen as ‘lowly’ and the business was one of both camaraderie and competition.</p>
<p>The way McInerney talks about the world he’s inhabited for more than thirty years is very matter of fact and unbiased. His interest, it is clear, is in capturing something beautiful, daring, intricate and real regardless of fashion. This book honours his success in doing just that.</p>
