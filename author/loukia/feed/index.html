				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Museum of Transology exhibition has been on display at LCF&#8217;s <a href="http://www.fashionspacegallery.com/">Fashion Space Gallery</a> for the past few months and it closes on April 22, so now is your last chance to go and check it out. The exhibition hosts the largest collection of trans artefacts and photographs ever to be displayed in the UK, and shows the many realities of modern trans life, whilst also posing a bigger question about the omission of trans lives from larger national museum collections.</p>

<p>After Fashion Space Gallery, the exhibition will be on display in Brighton Museum, from July 2017 until summer 2018. In an <a href="http://bit.ly/2pbwpp3">interview with LCF News</a>, the curator of the exhibition E-J Scott said:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the most wonderful things for me has been that at the end of the exhibition, there’s a hat rack coming out of the wall where everyone can leave a message, and it’s heaving with tags from people writing comments. What’s interesting is that it’s clear that it has become an exhibition that’s about more than trans, it’s about gender and about how gender roles affect everyone’s lives. It’s been hitting people personally whether they are trans or not, and for me that’s very interesting.</p></blockquote>
<p>He spoke about how the exhibition will be expanded at Brighton:</p>
<blockquote><p>There’s going to be new sections when it goes there – the way the the exhibition is formed at the moment, is that we tackled major issues affecting trans communities. In the new exhibition, the crux of the show will be the same, but we will have add on sections, and we will also engage with the permanent collection at the Brighton museum too, and explore the way objects within this, can represent people’s non normative gender experiences. We’ll hopefully use some items out of the costume collection for example, and look at fashion and gender. It’s going to be bigger, bolder and tackle new issues.</p></blockquote>
<p>The exhibition is on at Fashion Space Gallery until 22 April. It opens to the public at Brighton Museum on 20 July.
