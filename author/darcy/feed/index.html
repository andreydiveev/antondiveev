				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>P&amp;P sits down with LCF alum Sasha Harris, the Bespoke Tailoring graduate who is now Head Designer at supercool street brand Disturbing London.</em></p>

<p><em>Did you always want to work in fashion?</em></p>
<p>Fashion was the first and pretty much the only thing I have ever wanted to do. I have memories of being a kid and being asked what I wanted to be when I grew up and it was always fashion design. I obviously had no idea what that involved at the age of 5, but I knew I loved clothes. My family also has a background in design – my great-grandmother trained in fashion in early 1900s, my grandmother ran two boutiques in 60s and 70s and my mum was in fashion, designing stage clothes and wardrobe for music artists in UK and US in the 80s and 90s. I wasn&#8217;t even aware of this properly until I was a teenager, but it clearly runs in the family.</p>
<p><em>What is it about London that makes it such a fantastic city for fashion?</em></p>
<p>Where do I start? There are so many things – so much creativity, not just fashion related but art, music and theatre. What I like the most is the diversity of race, religion, culture – it’s like we have the world on our door step and you can either tap into that for inspiration or you can overlook it, but you definitely can&#8217;t deny that it all exists right here under our noses. I also love that each corner of London has a different pulse to it. North, east, south and west have their own different rhythms, different accents, different styles of doing things.</p>
<p><em>What attracted you to working for <a href="https://www.disturbinglondon.com/">Disturbing London</a> as a fashion brand?</em></p>
<p>I think it was mainly the way the opportunity came about to be honest. It happened in a very natural way that just felt right in my gut, one of those situations where you are in the right place at the right time. My boss, Dumi Oburota, came to the LCF Graduate show that I was in and ended up sitting next to my mum. My mum wasn&#8217;t actually meant to be watching the show as it was strictly for press and industry, but she managed to charm her way in. My mum didn&#8217;t know who Dumi was or what he did and was just starting friendly conversation, Dumi mentioned that Disturbing London had an apparel line and he was looking for a graduate designer to come on board to assist a head designer/creative director. My mum said that I was showing my final collection and they exchanged details. I then met with Dumi about 3 times over that summer to talk about the fashion side of the business and what his ambitions were for it and I put together some of my ideas and designs. After about 3/4 months of back and fourth I got the job as Head Designer.</p>

<p><em>Tell us about your role at DL.</em></p>
<p>Well anything to do with the fashion side of the business is basically my responsibility. I see the process through from research and concept, design to sampling, sourcing fabrics, production, press through gifting and beyond. I am essentially the core of team and work with a freelance graphic designer, pattern cutter or the manufacturing factory depending on the product and a production manger. Other team members at Disturbing London put their input in on the press and marketing side of things as well as creating visual content. I work primarily with a lot of freelancers and external companies, but as the fashion side of the business grows the more we will bring in house.</p>
<p><em>What’s your favourite part of the design process? Do you love the process or the product?</em></p>
<p>I definitely prefer the product more than the process. The process is cool when things move smoothly, but it’s a pretty intense process. At the end of the day, you want to see that product on someone and it’s so satisfying to see a product that you&#8217;ve designed on someone who has chosen to the spend their cash on it.</p>
<p><em>You studied <a href="http://www.arts.ac.uk/fashion/courses/undergraduate/ba-bespoke-tailoring/">Bespoke Tailoring</a> – how is this incorporated into your work at DL?</em></p>
<p>I think when you learn a practice like bespoke tailoring, it really sets a solid foundation for whatever you&#8217;re creating. So I guess its the principles of creating well made clothes with a heavy focus on fit and attention to detail that are incorporated the most into what I do at DL.</p>
<p><em>DL has collaborated with amazing brands such as Nike. What other brands do you dream of collaborating with?</em></p>
<p>I would love to collaborate with Converse! It goes without saying that Converse has this easy coolness to it, but I particularly like that it’s an honest brand. I think that’s the hardest quality for a fashion brand to have, especially for how long its been going for. I see Converse as quite a classic brand and a staple item to have in your wardrobe, something that’s accessible that most people own. Also nearly all of the Disturbing London team wear Converse on a daily basis, so it just makes perfect sense to me.</p>

<p><em>How did LCF prepare you for a career in the fashion industry?</em></p>
<p>Well it did and at the same time it didn&#8217;t. I feel like university can only prepare you so much and the more you take advantage of that while you&#8217;re at university, the better position you&#8217;re in when you graduate. I personally found it really hard to balance studying, earning money and interning. I definitely wish my course was a four year course with a sandwich year so it actually gives you the time to focus on getting real experience in the industry, without also having to worry about university work. But I also did have the best time being around that creative energy everyday. I met amazing people, had great tutors who actually worked in the industry and learnt important skills.</p>
<p><em>What advice would you give to emerging designers at the start of their career?</em></p>
<p>I think try and be very self-analytical about your strengths and weaknesses. Know if you would prefer working for a big brand that is more established or a new and upcoming brand. Keep in mind that you will probably learn more about every element of a fashion brand working for a new and upcoming label, whereas the big brands are more rigid so you won&#8217;t really see or experience other parts of the business that are not part of your job role. Finally if you don&#8217;t know exactly what part of the fashion industry you are interested in, then go and experience everything. Figuring out what you don&#8217;t want to do takes you one step closer to finding what you do want to do.</p>

<p>Fashion Month always “breaks the internet”. Instagram and Twitter feeds are inundated with runway snaps and pics of bloggers donning the most coveted designer threads. It is perhaps one of the most exciting elements of fashion.</p>
<p>Yet, more frequently, the anticipation of street attire outside the show is becoming more influential than the runway itself. Journalists, socialites and bloggers work their own catwalk, with inspiring wardrobes more attractive for daily life.</p>
<p>Whether it is an eccentric style mix or the preened chic aesthetic, photographers burst into a frenzy at every show, aiming for the best of the street style stars. <a href="http://www.vogue.co.uk/topic/street-chic"><em>Vogue UK</em> dedicates features praising their successes</a>. Yet, interestingly their sister title <em>Vogue</em> <em>US </em><a href="http://www.vogue.com/13483417/milan-fashion-week-spring-2017-vogue-editors-chat/">dubbed the blogger stars of the streets as “pathetic”</a> advising that they “find another business”. The controversial <em>Vogue</em> article was met with criticism, as renowned bloggers like <a href="http://fashionista.com/2016/09/vogue-criticism-bryanboy-susie-bubble">Susie Bubble and Bryan Boy defended their industry</a> – including their millions of followers who Tweeted in angered response.</p>

<p>The underlying message here seems to be that <em>Vogue US</em> feels threatened by bloggers and influencers alike on the streets and the front row. The idea that independent street style stars have a growing authority on purchases must trouble the <em>Vogue</em> editors.</p>
<p>But there is a case to say that it is street style that makes Fashion Week a success. From the outlandish to the chic, the pre-show buzz that occurs outside creates hype and makes Fashion Week more than just an event for industry insiders. These bloggers and sartorial characters open up the once exclusive fashion sphere to a global market.</p>
<p>Founder of fashion blog <a href="http://www.manrepeller.com/"><em>Man Repeller</em></a>, Leandra Medine has over 1.5 million followers on Instagram, all waiting to see her next outfit. It is this friendlier and more carefree approach which is inspiring industry outsiders, bringing a welcoming element to fashion, rather than a V.I.P only editors front row.</p>
<div id="attachment_15960" style="width: 940px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-15960" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-22-at-15.22.39.png" alt="Instagram @mrstreetpeeper" width="930" height="550" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-22-at-15.22.39.png 930w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-22-at-15.22.39-310x183.png 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-22-at-15.22.39-768x454.png 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-22-at-15.22.39-470x278.png 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-22-at-15.22.39-600x355.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Instagram @mrstreetpeeper</p></div>
<p>It is true then that street style is incredibly relevant for the future of fashion. While the pure glamour and extravagant staging of a real runway could never be underestimated, the catwalk and street style are inspiring each other. This mix of the new and the old; the glamour and the accessible; and the DIY vs the establishment is what keeps fashion interesting and the sooner the <em>Vogue US</em> editors admit this the better it will be for the industry.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Pigeons &amp; Peacocks 9: The Post-Internet Issue is our best magazine yet, and is also editor <a href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/tag/darcy-rive/">Darcy Rive’</a>s last. Here, he says goodbye and thanks all the contributors for making P&amp;P what it is today. </em></p>
<p><em><a href="http://estore.arts.ac.uk/browse/extra_info.asp?compid=1&amp;modid=1&amp;deptid=176&amp;catid=31&amp;prodid=1971">Pigeons &amp; Peacocks 9: The Post-Internet Issue</a> </em>is now out. This real and tangible printed magazine explores the digital and intangible realm of the internet, questioning its influence on fashion, society, relationships and culture. We discover how apps have shaped body image, how data is tracked, how visibility is saving society’s minorities and how new materials are being developed in machines and in petri dishes to push the boundaries of fashion and save our planet. And, of course, the magazine is filled with inspirational and profound images courtesy of the talents of London College of Fashion and our international readership. It is a great issue.</p>
<p>The <em>Post-Internet </em>issue is a great magazine, and it is also my last one as editor. I joined the <em>Pigeons &amp; Peacocks </em>team over three years ago, straight out of Master’s in <a href="http://www.arts.ac.uk/fashion/courses/postgraduate/ma-fashion-journalism/">Fashion Journalism</a>. I had known the magazine from my time studying at LCF, had ripped its pages out of the spine and stuck them to my wall. And then I was lucky enough to join its editorial team.</p>
<p>Throughout my time at the magazine, I have had to privilege to work with some of the most talented, inspiring and hard-working creatives. I have seen stories come to life through the lens of a photographer’s camera, capturing moments in time and holding them forever. I have witnessed stylists create characters in clothing, playing dress up and transcending inanimate garments into living personalities. I have been captivated by the words of writers whose opinions and perspectives have broadened my own. I consider it a great honour to have met and worked with these people, whose vision and skills have the power to change the industry, society and maybe even the world.</p>
<p>I’d like to take the opportunity to thank all our contributors to <em>Pigeons &amp; Peacocks </em>magazine over the last three and half years for making it what it is today. And I’d like to thank all the readers, from all over the globe, for being part of our journey. I am so excited to see the next chapter of <em>P&amp;P </em>and wish the next team and the all coming contributors the very best.</p>
