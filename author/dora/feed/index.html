				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What&#8217;s on your plate? The stuff we shove into our mouths can be quite a personal affair, especially today, when we&#8217;re aware of the unhealthy side effects of eating processed fatty foods but just don&#8217;t know how to make something from scratch that actually tastes good. Canadian food blogger Laura from <a href="http://www.thefirstmess.com/">The First Mess</a> shows us how to cook up some healthy alternatives that she presents in beautiful photographs and easy-to-follow recipes. What&#8217;s so great about her blog is that it seems unpretentious, in the best possible meaning of the word. There&#8217;s a little story behind each recipe, and although some of the ingredients can be quite unusual, you won&#8217;t have to venture out to buy all of them in Wholefoods or spend your hard earned dough on bucket loads of, say, macadamia nuts. While her blog is vegan, it is not exclusive to vegan palates. To <em>Pigeons &amp; Peacocks</em>, Laura speaks about her favourite flavours, experiencing food through the five senses and the correlation between food and fashion.</p>

<p><strong>P&amp;P: How did <a href="http://www.thefirstmess.com/">The First Mess</a> come to life?</strong></p>
<p>Laura: I had a bit of extra time on my hands after I finished my culinary nutrition diploma, and I had been working in restaurants for a while at that point. My friend suggested that I start sharing some of the cool stuff I had learned along the way online. I started posting kind of infrequently, but kept at it. And here we are!</p>
<p><strong>P&amp;P: What similarities do you see between food and fashion?</strong></p>
<p>Laura: There are certain detectable trends/movements in food, just as with fashion and design. Right now, real food with a focus on cooking at home seems to be reigning supreme. I hope the momentum on this keeps holding strong and that people will still get excited about kale and quinoa in the years to come. It just seems like good food in general is having a moment in mainstream media.</p>
<p><strong><a ref="magnificPopup" href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/fresh-papaya-salad-rolls-FINAL-8.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12443" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/fresh-papaya-salad-rolls-FINAL-8.jpg" alt="fresh-papaya-salad-rolls-FINAL-8" width="745" height="497" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/fresh-papaya-salad-rolls-FINAL-8.jpg 745w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/fresh-papaya-salad-rolls-FINAL-8-310x207.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/fresh-papaya-salad-rolls-FINAL-8-470x314.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/fresh-papaya-salad-rolls-FINAL-8-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>P&amp;P: What makes food blogs so successful at the moment?</strong></p>
<p>Laura: I think food blogs are successful because the personalities behind them are empathetic towards the situation of the home cook. I don&#8217;t have a totally stacked kitchen and 10-20 years of kitchen experience behind me, and the content on my site reflects this. I think the typical home cook sees a bit of themselves in the methods chosen on any given food blog. There&#8217;s a stronger connection there because right off the bat, it&#8217;s so much easier to relate.</p>
<p><strong>P&amp;P: Which other current food trends do you see happening?</strong></p>
<p>Laura: I honestly try to not pay attention to discussions of trends. I specifically avoid articles that talk about food in this good/evil sort of way. It&#8217;s just food and it&#8217;s all good. But like I said before, I think eating for wellness AND pleasure is definitely having a moment right now — which is something I&#8217;m very excited about.</p>
<p><strong>P&amp;P: This one&#8217;s a bit out there — what happens to your five senses when you eat a good dish?</strong></p>
<p>Laura: I do eat with my eyes first, so even if we&#8217;re just having a really basic pasta for dinner, I try to dress it up a bit with herbs and toasted nuts and things. It ramps up the anticipation. Touch is something I connect with a lot in terms of food and preparation of said food because we rarely eat out. Sound is a funny one. I like the sound of a fork cracking through a charred crust or something, but chewing noises kind of weird me out. Smells and aroma get at that whole anticipation thing again. Taste is an obvious one — if something&#8217;s really good, I feel like my whole body is smiling.</p>
<p><a ref="magnificPopup" href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/selfportrait1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12444" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/selfportrait1.jpg" alt="selfportrait1" width="876" height="1314" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/selfportrait1.jpg 876w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/selfportrait1-310x465.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/selfportrait1-470x705.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/selfportrait1-300x450.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>P&amp;P: What are your favourite tastes?</strong></p>
<p>Laura: I used to prefer sweet things, but now I tend to reach for salty, brine-y, and bitter items — olives, capers, miso, broccoli rabe, mustard greens and the like.</p>
<p><strong>P&amp;P: Which are the most fashionable ingredients for you right now?</strong></p>
<p>Laura: I&#8217;m honestly not sure because as I said, I kind of avoid discussions with those sort of topics. It seems like fermented foods are still riding the trend wave though, so I&#8217;ll go with that. Miso, sourdough, tempeh, kombucha, beer, kimchi, sauerkraut — all awesome things that I really love.</p>
<p><strong>P&amp;P: Can you predict where the food trend is going next?</strong></p>
<p>Laura: Absolutely no clue! I&#8217;m hoping it will start veering towards a culture of just sensible and simple eating/cooking, i.e. no fad diets or forbidden foods etc. I think living with wellness is within everyone&#8217;s reach, and a little simplification of that goal would help us all get a little closer. If you start with real, whole foods prepared at home, you&#8217;re 75% there I think.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Accessories designer Youmeng Liu’s<em> Series I </em>as part of her label <a href="http://www.dreamscode.co.uk/">Dream&#8217;s Code</a> continues an ancient embroidery craftsmanship of the South China Provinces that she teams with beautiful leathers using traditional techniques. <em>P&amp;P</em> spoke to the MA Fashion Artefact 2014 graduate about her London-based label and her advice for graduates wanting to set up their own brand.</p>
<p><strong><a ref="magnificPopup" href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/DREAMS-CODE-profile-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12377" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/DREAMS-CODE-profile-1.jpg" alt="DREAM'S CODE profile 1" width="1000" height="1698" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/DREAMS-CODE-profile-1.jpg 1000w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/DREAMS-CODE-profile-1-310x526.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/DREAMS-CODE-profile-1-442x750.jpg 442w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/DREAMS-CODE-profile-1-300x509.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a> </strong></p>
<p><strong>P&amp;P: Tell us about your background. What brought you to London?</strong></p>
<p>Youmeng Liu: When I was a little girl, my grandma designed and made bespoke garments for people in my hometown. I was taught how to cut and stitch clothes by her. Then I found out that I have a crazy imagination  and really love fashion design. After my BA in Womenswear in China, I decided to come abroad for further study. I really like British culture. My favourite designer is <a href="http://www.vogue.co.uk/spy/biographies/hussein-chalayan-biography">Hussein Chalayan</a> who has won British Designer of the Year twice. I believe London is a great place that would allow me to get more inspiration, and it is also a fantastic place to start my future career.</p>
<p><strong>P&amp;P: You graduated from MA Fashion Artifact at LCF. In what way did your expectations match your experience? Was there anything you learned that surprised you?</strong></p>
<p>Youmeng: During the MA Fashion Artefact course at LCF, I learned a lot of new techniques and got many new ideas. One of the best things was that I found out I love leather more than fabric. My MA subject was titled <em><a href="http://showtime.arts.ac.uk/Youmeng">Alive Tile Cat</a></em>, this subject connected fashion with many other fields such as machinery technology, the internet of things, information control, mathematics and so on. The experience of cutting and sewing leather was so exciting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a ref="magnificPopup" href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/DREAMS-CODE-profile-9.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12379" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/DREAMS-CODE-profile-9.jpg" alt="DREAM'S CODE profile 9" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/DREAMS-CODE-profile-9.jpg 1000w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/DREAMS-CODE-profile-9-310x465.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/DREAMS-CODE-profile-9-470x705.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/DREAMS-CODE-profile-9-300x450.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>P&amp;P: What&#8217;s your favourite part of London?</strong></p>
<p>Youmeng: Three years ago I moved to London and have lived near Bond Street ever since. I quite like central London because I can see key fashion brands’ new releases first hand. My favourite area of London is South Kensington. There are a lot of museums such as the <a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk">Victoria &amp; Albert</a> and the <a href="http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk">Science Museum</a>. I enjoy spending my spare time there finding gorgeous art from the past and looking at new techniques.</p>
<p><strong>P&amp;P: Could you tell us a bit about your embroidery technique?</strong></p>
<p>Youmeng: There are various embroidery techniques: flat, plaited, knit, wound, crape, stretching, stitching, rolling, sticking and embroidery with split thread, 3D embroidery and so on. Flat embroidery is the most commonly used method, it’s simple and suitable for small figures; plaited embroidery is to plait 8-12 colorful silk threads into a “braid” and circle and sew around it on cloth; knit embroidery is to insert needle in the cloth, round thread on the needle and take out the needle; stitching embroidery is to stitch regularly all kinds of geometric figures and deformed flowers, birds, butterflies, etc. In all of the techniques, 3D double-sided embroidery is quite unique. I developed the technique from the old Bai Minority. Making one piece to embroider the pattern from flat to three dimensional is quite time consuming. And the amazing thing is the great visual effects and unique sense of touch of the embroidery. Now I&#8217;ve realised that I opened a door to a magic 3D world.</p>
<p><a ref="magnificPopup" href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/Dreams-Code-lookbook9.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12376" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/Dreams-Code-lookbook9.jpg" alt="Dream's Code lookbook9" width="1000" height="799" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/Dreams-Code-lookbook9.jpg 1000w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/Dreams-Code-lookbook9-310x248.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/Dreams-Code-lookbook9-470x376.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/Dreams-Code-lookbook9-300x240.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>P&amp;P: Who are you designing for?</strong></p>
<p>Youmeng Liu: Our brand <a href="http://www.dreamscode.co.uk/">Dream’s Code</a> is an affordable luxury brand based in London. Our target customers are women from 25 to 65 years old who have a similar aesthetic to the brand and really like its culture and stories. Our goal is to combine traditional techniques with modern aesthetic theories.  The design not only embraces folk culture, but also bestows eternal vitality into each product. Our rich colour accessories present the best craftsmanship from the very best artisans of embroidery. In our workshop, all of the members are from the older minorities, and therefore only the very best artworks are produced.</p>
<p><strong>P&amp;P: Finally, what advice do you have for students or (young) creatives starting their journey?</strong></p>
<p>Youmeng Liu: Do not hesitate to get every chance to show you creativity. Taking action is the best way to get new experience. This is also the reason I got support from <a href="http://www.arts.ac.uk/student-jobs-and-careers/">SEE</a> and <a href="http://www.itsweb.org/jsp/en/index/index.jsp">ITS</a>. My second advice is: the cooperation between different fields is quite important for young creatives. It helps a lot to get professional advice from graphic and digital designers, photographers, video makers and so on. You can’t make all of the designs best all by yourself. Asking for experience from successful alumni is my last advice. Young creatives can learn more real experience and fulfill their ideas in a more effective way.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The collection seeks to push the boundaries of footwear by introducing a new typology of immovable footwear through the use of concrete. In the use of this heavy, unrefined, naturally weathering material, the collection entraps and restricts the wearer’s movements, slowing down the pace of daily life, and thus our experience of time. This physical act of slow movement seeks to influence the psyche into decelerating the processing of imagery that is generated by today’s mass consumer society. In this way, the act of wearing becomes a multi-sensory experience, where tactile qualities are accentuated, and where the experience of the ‘self’ is enhanced.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK market is a tough one to break. ‘<em>If I can make it there, I’ll make it anywhere</em>’ might be what they sing across the pond, but it’s still in tune with the London fashion scene. With its unique status as one of the four big fashion capitals of the world, London attracts creatives and students from all over the globe and sells them the dream of becoming part of an exciting scene that has spawned icons including Vivienne Westwood, Alexander McQueen and Paul Smith.</p>
<p>It’s hard enough to break into the London fashion scene as a native Brit, but what if you’re far away from home and still finding your own feet in the Big Smoke? You might be nodding along and smiling even though you still don’t know what people are saying after you’ve already asked them to repeat themselves three times. You might be able to get away with this in a social situation, but what if you’re trying to run a business where detail is crucial?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/?p=11732&amp;preview=true">P&amp;P reported about the Fashion Bloc</a> that challenges our perceptions of the Eastern European fashion scene, the <a href="http://baltriatic.com/designers/">Baltriatic</a> is an initiative created by Monika Bodera, Director of fashion market consultancy <a href="http://www.polarity.uk.com/">Polarity UK</a>, that helps Eastern European fashion designers launch their career in the UK. “We are not a funding body, we are looking to provide the contacts to organisations which can offer help, including financial help”, explains Bodera. “The region of Europe from the North of the Baltic to the South of the Adriatic covers some of the most exciting fashion destinations in the world. This relatively small geographical area is extremely diverse and soaked in the greatly varied cultures of each country.”</p>
<div id="attachment_11736" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a ref="magnificPopup" href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/11/IMG_5602.JPG.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-11736" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/11/IMG_5602.JPG.jpg" alt="Designs by Adam Ptacek" width="1000" height="523" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/11/IMG_5602.JPG.jpg 1000w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/11/IMG_5602.JPG-310x162.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/11/IMG_5602.JPG-470x246.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/11/IMG_5602.JPG-300x157.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Designs by Adam Ptacek</p></div>
<p>The Baltriatic is a two-way street. Apart from supporting London-based fashion designers from Eastern Europe, their mission is also to help increase the reputation of its fashion from to the UK and beyond. Monika Bodera, a Polish national, describes that, “Unfortunately, there is confusion and negative stereotyping with regard to anything Eastern European. We want to create a visual journey from the Baltic States all the way to the Post-Yugoslavian nations to reflect on and embrace the culture of the region coming out of the ex-communist doctrine. This is an increasingly important region for fashion with its rich cultural heritage and its people are driven to make changes.”</p>
<div id="attachment_11735" style="width: 606px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a ref="magnificPopup" href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/11/collection-11-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-11735" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/11/collection-11-1.jpg" alt="Design by From Warsaw" width="596" height="882" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/11/collection-11-1.jpg 596w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/11/collection-11-1-310x459.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/11/collection-11-1-470x696.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/11/collection-11-1-300x444.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Design by From Warsaw</p></div>
<p>Graduates can approach the Baltriatic to receive support. “We used to be a fashion showroom for buyers, but recognised that buying is the end of the road. Now we look at the beginning, at building the brand, working on PR and marketing. Once we’ve established this part, we can go on and work on a big portfolio and generate sales.”, states Monika Bodera before illustrating the status of national culture. “With culture, there are two strong aspects. One is food, the second is fashion, it’s an expression of national culture. A lot of people are influenced by their national culture and you can see this in fashion, if you look carefully for it.”</p>

<p>The Baltriatic’s objective is to work with public and private sectors. Over a year ago, they created a showroom in Haggerston that was displaying samples from designers from Romania, the Czech Republic, Poland to Croatia and other Eastern European countries. In a pop-up shop during London Fashion Week AW15, Baltriatic designers&#8217; creations attracted quite a bit of interest from industry guests including photographers.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Classic situation. Early morning, you’re running late, bag and keys in one hand, a cup in the other as you’re chug-a-lugging a lukewarm coffee down your throat and, <em>ta-da</em>, also your t-shirt. It’s always in those situations in which you cannot afford to delay any further that you trip up and accidents happen. But what if the top you’re wearing was smart enough to take into account that you, as a person, can be a tiny bit clumsy at times and were to look out for you?</p>
<p><a ref="magnificPopup" href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/12/ink-tee-300dpi.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11936" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/12/ink-tee-300dpi.jpg" alt="ink-tee-300dpi" width="1000" height="769" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/12/ink-tee-300dpi.jpg 1000w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/12/ink-tee-300dpi-310x238.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/12/ink-tee-300dpi-470x361.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/12/ink-tee-300dpi-300x231.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>There’s something called a hydrophobic tee. It might sound like something a bit politically incorrect but what it actually means is that the fabric has been treated to be water repellent. Hydrophobic hates water. Or any fluid for that matter. <a href="http://www.reality-dreams.co.uk/">Reality Dreams</a>, the t-shirt company behind this special effect claims that “nano-particles enter the microscopic natural pores and capillaries of the fabric surface, smoothing out tiny imperfections and covalently bonding to the substrate material to create a hydrophobic, highly protective, long lasting barrier, which is durable, non-invasive and protects against damage caused by water, pollution, UV, dirt and fouling.”</p>
<p><a ref="magnificPopup" href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/12/Rose_300dpi.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11938" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/12/Rose_300dpi.jpg" alt="Rose_300dpi" width="1000" height="1504" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/12/Rose_300dpi.jpg 1000w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/12/Rose_300dpi-310x466.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/12/Rose_300dpi-470x707.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/12/Rose_300dpi-300x451.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>I’ve given it a try and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIdn18CB9W0">the effect</a> is really quite surreal and astonishing. As for my own personal clumsiness, after wearing the tee a few times, I accidentally put it in the hot wash, thus ruining the REP-L fabric formula. (It might protect against stains but it still seemed odd to me to not wash an item of clothing after having worn it.) The tees come with a disclaimer, hand wash and non-bio detergent only. Oops.</p>
<p><a ref="magnificPopup" href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/12/reality-dreams-dogtooth.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11937" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/12/reality-dreams-dogtooth.jpg" alt="reality-dreams-dogtooth" width="1000" height="708" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/12/reality-dreams-dogtooth.jpg 1000w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/12/reality-dreams-dogtooth-310x219.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/12/reality-dreams-dogtooth-470x333.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/12/reality-dreams-dogtooth-300x212.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;I recently moved to London to study at LCF, being originally from Edinburgh in Scotland. When we were given our first project, I immediately thought of home. After extensive research and visiting the Celtic exhibition at the British Museum, I decided to create an editorial based on modern Celtic identity. I contacted my friends from Scotland and they sent me some of their designs. The models have auburn hair because over 10% of the population in Scotland have red hair. The blue paint represents <em>woad</em>, a dye used by Scottish people in the iron age as war paint and fabric dye.&#8221; — Natalie Baxter</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>While the ingredients listed in industrially produced food items look like they are straight out of the lab -azodicarbonamide, E101, monosodium glutamate or zoalene, for example, a counter food culture has established itself promoting so-called &#8216;clean eating&#8217; of unprocessed foods that are free from artificial substances and refined sugars. But what if you&#8217;re already hooked on mass market products? Australian food blogger <a href="https://instagram.com/talinegabriel/?hl=en">Taline Gabrielian</a> from <a href="http://hippielane.com.au">The Hippie Lane</a> has a fashionable taste when it comes to providing healthy alternatives to all-time classics.</em></p>
<p>Food and fashion, it’s a funny one. Despite both of them evolving around taste, their relationship has not always been amicable.</p>
<p>At this point, however, food is bang on trend. It’s a no brainer that what you’re putting inside your body is going to have an effect on the way you look and feel. The web is full of articles giving scientific evidence to show how food could help you stay healthy and energetic and how certain foods might prevent or even cure diseases.</p>
<p>The trend is towards natural ingredients and doing as little harm to animals as possible, sadly sometimes at the expense of our planet. For example, soy is a popular substitute for dairy but soybean agriculture is destroying ecosystems and rainforests. In Paleolythic (short Paleo) diets, however, soy is out. The diet allows you to eat what our cavemen ancestors might have consumed before they started farming, except with the sort of 21st century twist that looks beautiful on your plate. Taline&#8217;s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/talinegabriel/">Instagram</a> account is an infinite scroll of mouthwatering meals and has attracted a six digit number of food lovers.</p>

<p>P&amp;P: How did the Hippie Lane come to life?</p>
<p>TG: I was told by my doctor to avoid allergen foods, gluten, soy, dairy and egg, to help with my gut health. I started experimenting with gluten free vegan treats and became obsessed with recipe developing. It just grew from there.</p>
<p>P&amp;P: On your website you state that, “Health is the new black.” What similarities do you see between food and fashion?</p>
<p>TG: Food is evolving, as is fashion. There are food trends that come and go, and health is definitely where it&#8217;s at currently.</p>
<p>P&amp;P: What makes food blogs so successful at the moment?</p>
<p>TG: I don’t know anyone who doesn’t love food. In fact, most people are consumed with it. We plan what we’d like to eat each day, organise social gatherings and events around food and feel our most comfortable and relaxed at the dinner table. Healthy food is all the rage and many people turn to blogs for advice, education and motivation. We also want to access new recipes and be up-to-date with what’s hot in the world of food.</p>
<p>P&amp;P: Which other current food trends do you see happening?</p>
<p>TG: Vegan and Paleo diets have taken centre stage with many people attracted to the idea of one or the other and giving one or both a try. Gluten free food has been on the rise for at least a few years now, with quinoa and buckwheat grains becoming a mainstream option. Sugar free foods are highly sought after with many new fructose free and natural sugar brands hitting the market.</p>
<p>P&amp;P: This one’s a bit out there—what happens to your five senses when you eat a good dish?</p>
<p>TG: Hey, I may need a science degree to answer this one! I think the look of a meal begins with</p>
<p>our sensory experience. Presentation is key in getting the appetite racing. We then attempt to take more sensory stimulus with our sense of smell. Once we are positively convinced with the first two senses, we look forward to taking the first mouthful. The texture is what we become aware of as we take a bite. When you’re eating a delicious meal, you become aware of each flavour. Each mouthful works towards a positive response of all your senses, resulting in a heightening of pleasure.</p>
<p>P&amp;P: What are your favourite tastes?</p>
<p>TG: I’m a sweet tooth, but not the refined type. I love naturally sweet dishes. Acai bowls and homemade granola and rawnola [grain free &#8216;cereal&#8217; consisting of nuts, seeds, dried fruit and spices] are what I go for when I need a comforting hit.</p>
<p>P&amp;P: What are the most fashionable ingredients for you right now?</p>
<p>TG: Coconut products are definitely on trend. People are widely incorporating coconut oil and coconut water in their recipes.</p>
<p>P&amp;P: Can you predict where the food trend is going next?</p>
<p>TG: Healthy is where it’s staying. There will be less emphasis on meat and animal products and more interest in plant-based by vegetarian dishes.</p>
