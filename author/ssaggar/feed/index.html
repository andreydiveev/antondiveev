[columns]The Royal Opera House’s high ceilings and beautiful Victorian features played host to 10 handpicked young designers at London College of Fashion’s highly anticipated MA13 show. Debuting for the first time at London Fashion Week, the show highlighted the importance of up-and-coming graduates acting at the forefront of fashion.</p>
<p>With guests such as singer Lianne La Havas and girl band Stooshe in attendance, as well as influential fashion editors, Simon Chilvers and Jess Cartner-Morley, the event was a must-see in a busy LFW schedule. Simon Chilvers later tweeted his support for one student, labeling <a href="http://showtime.arts.ac.uk/YIXIE">Yi Xie’s</a> digital dresses as a ‘tight collection with commercial bite’.[/columns]

<div id="attachment_4436" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a ref="magnificPopup" href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2013/02/LCF_MA2013_054XinSun1.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4436" alt="Menswear from Xin Sun" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2013/02/LCF_MA2013_054XinSun1-470x327.jpg" width="470" height="327" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2013/02/LCF_MA2013_054XinSun1-470x327.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2013/02/LCF_MA2013_054XinSun1-310x215.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2013/02/LCF_MA2013_054XinSun1-300x208.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2013/02/LCF_MA2013_054XinSun1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Menswear from Xin Sun</p></div>
<p>The MA13 catwalk showing as part of LFW meant that key industry figures were able to see the graduates’ work first-hand. “I think it’s great that LCF showed as part of Fashion Week,” Underground’s Beth Swade, who designed the footwear to accompany <a href="http://showtime.arts.ac.uk/ginaxsun">Xin Sun’s</a> collection, told LCF. “The graduates have put in a lot of work, and I hope they’re rewarded for it,” she added.</p>
<p>The 10 designers showcased their work on a diamond-shaped catwalk, with key guests receiving a 360 degree view of the collections on show. In keeping with LCF’s recent series <a href="http://www.fashion.arts.ac.uk/showcase/lcfmen/">LCFMen</a>, 4 of the chosen collections were menswear. MA Fashion Design Technology graduate, <a href="http://showtime.arts.ac.uk/NaDi">Na Di’s</a> Chinese painting-inspired floral suits proved a hit with the audience. After the show Karis Anderson, from girl band Stooshe, revealed that the printed tailoring was a firm favourite with the group. “We wanted everything,” she exclaimed, “but we especially loved [Na Di’s] printed suits”.</p>
<p>It seems suits were the order of the day – or at least where menswear is concerned – with tailoring a prominent reference throughout. <a href="http://showtime.arts.ac.uk/AntoniaLloyd">Antonia Lloyd’s</a> collection offered a new twist on the traditional mens’ suit, with clever use of colour blocking achieving a sporty, yet smart aesthetic. Models were styled with white socks and large backpacks, adding a clean edge to the looks.</p>

<p>Each collection stood out as an individual offering, however the catwalk was executed to perfection, blending seamlessly from one designer to the next alongside a sound track put together by Groove Armada&#8217;s Tom Findley. Opening with <a href="http://showtime.arts.ac.uk/maddalenamangialavori">Maddalena Mangialavori’s</a> crocheted leather garments and weaving through <a href="http://showtime.arts.ac.uk/menaisian">Sian Davies’</a> minimalism, <a href="http://showtime.arts.ac.uk/minwu">Min Wu’s</a> subtle colour gradients and <a href="http://showtime.arts.ac.uk/MA2013">Keiko Nishiyama’s</a> garden florals, the catwalk showcased the broad range of talent on offer at LCF. Inspiration behind the collections ranged from the objectification of women, to the split minds of schizophrenics, and spectacles inspired by alchemy.</p>
<p>The show was streamed live online, and SHOWstudio’s Lou Stoppard hosted a live discussion with an expert panel including i-D’s Milly McMahon, LCF Alumnus Fannie Schiavoni, Stylist Fred Butler and PORT magazine’s David Hellqvist, who were in unison over the unique nature of each individual collection.</p>
