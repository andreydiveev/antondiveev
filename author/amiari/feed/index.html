<p><b>London College of Fashion&#8217;s Professor of Fashion and Science Helen Storey was recently announced as RSA&#8217;s new Royal Designer for Industry, which is one of the highest accolades a designer can receive in the UK. Here, Anastasia Miari chats to Storey about her revolutionary Catalytic Clothing, the bond between fashion and science and attitudes towards consumption.  </b> Artist Helen Storey’s career in fashion began back in the 80s and she is now Professor of Fashion Science at University of the Arts London’s <a href="http://www.arts.ac.uk/research/ual-research-centres/centre-for-sustainable-fashion/">Centre for Sustainable Fashion</a>. Winning <em>Most Innovative Designer</em> and <em>Best Designer Exporter</em> in 1990, Storey’s beginnings in the industry hinted at a future in which she would unite fashion and science. The result of years of collaborations with scientists is The Helen Storey Foundation, an organisation promoting creativity, innovation, and the bond between science and fashion. Since its establishment in ’97, the foundation has led a number of cross-collaborative projects, fusing technology, art and science; it’s most notable being the recent ‘Cat-Clo’ (Catalytic Clothing) project. This collaboration between Storey and chemist Tony Ryan employs existing technology applied to textiles, in order to purify the air. The pair have worked on a “magic” laundry detergent that turns clothes into air-purifiers when worn. If Catalytic Clothing is given the OK from the government, and all laundry brands are subsequently required to include the purifying technology within their products, this could signal the solution to pollution and emissions in our atmosphere. Quite the feat for a fashion designer…   <strong>How did the transition between fashion and science come about, because you were primarily a very successful fashion designer?</strong> It was the Welcome Trust’s idea to get artists and scientists together back in 1997. The idea was to try and find a way for artists and scientists to have a collaboration that could grab the public imagination towards science in brand new ways. Traditionally, people that go towards the arts lean away from science but we do have a lot in common – we&#8217;ve just lost the language.   <strong>How do you, as an artist, go about learning the ‘language’ of science?</strong> The whole success is premised on meeting the right human being who happens to be a scientist. They have to find a way to demystify their world. If I can get it, anyone can get it. Part of collaboration is developing this language that allows an entry into the complexity of the world of science and then my job is to bring that to life and keep some of the amazing conversations we have alive visually.   <strong>That doesn’t sound easy…</strong> You have to be a deep listener. You&#8217;re listening out to what the scientists are focusing on. You&#8217;re looking out for the jewels in it, the things that surprise us that don&#8217;t surprise scientists. There&#8217;s always something that blows me away and I think, “this is mad that the world doesn&#8217;t know about this.”   <strong>Is that what happened with <em>Cat-Clo</em>?</strong> <em>Cat-Clo</em> is actually a technology that already exists in different forms. It already exists in paint and in toothpastes and in sunscreen. What we learned from how it’s used on urban surfaces – like pavements around Westminster – is that it’s not actually very effective in terms of dealing with pollution when it&#8217;s on a concrete surface as opposed to when it&#8217;s on us. We&#8217;re wearing fibres – every fibre is 360 degrees – when you unwind all of those, your surface area is as large as a tennis court. When about 100 people start to wear <em>Catalytic Clothing</em>, that’s when it starts to make a difference to the air and levels of pollution around those wearing it.   <strong>How did you make the link between the technology used on tarmac and clothes?</strong> That came about as a continued conversation from a previous project I worked on with Tony Ryan, <em>Wonderland</em>. We did a workshop with young people and what it meant to be a scientist and an artist and they couldn&#8217;t see what the difference was. One of the girls around the table who was about 12 years old said, &#8216;I don&#8217;t see why you don&#8217;t make use of something that already exists rather than making new things.&#8217; That’s when Catalytic Clothing was born.   <strong>It’s such a ground breaking idea – why aren’t we all wearing Cat-Clo now?</strong> I hope we will all be wearing it soon but it needs to be everywhere to work. One person makes very little difference but crowds of people do. The only problem is at the moment, once that technology is on your clothes; it’s on there for good. So the detergent companies essentially only sell it to you once. Then how do they make money? The only way it will work to its fullest potential is if all the laundry brands use the technology and have their own version of it. It would have a huge impact on the health care bill so the government could choose to legislate it and everyone would have to use it for this reason.   <strong>What would you say to people that can’t see a link between fashion and science?</strong> Fashion is science. Everything you wear is a process of science. Every emotion you have is neuroscience. Science is everything that we are, everything that we touch, everything that we eat, everything that we breathe – how can it not having anything to do with fashion? Fashion is just the aesthetic or the result of that science locked into a particular form at some time. It&#8217;s absolutely everywhere. I think fashion designers need to realise the depth of the possibility with science by meeting the right people.   <strong>Are you concerned that there isn’t enough thought going into the design and creation of fashion?</strong> Everybody’s got concerns about the fashion industry. I think anyone who has an awareness of what&#8217;s happening in the world has a concern about how much we’re consuming. There&#8217;s a lot of work that gets done on looking at the life cycle of fashion and how it’s produced. At the root of overconsumption is us as individuals. Knowing more about what we want, when we want it is important. You need to bring awareness to consumption. The bigger change needs to happen in public consciousness. Beyond the surface it&#8217;s just greed and we as individuals have to watch out for that.   <strong>How is that possible in a world in which we’re constantly bombarded with the latest ‘must-buy’ garments?</strong> The next time you want to buy something, put a gap between the moment you feel you want to buy it and walk away. What you&#8217;ll find is that when you walk away, the urgency to buy will fade. Kids in primary school now are talking about climate change in a way that they never have before, it will come naturally to them to think about the environment. If all of us start behaving differently, we will force the system to change.   Keep up to date on the progress of Cat-Clo and other projects at <a href="http://www.helenstoreyfoundation.org">The Helen Storey Foundation website</a> or follow Helen on <a href="https://twitter.com/ProfHelenStorey">Twitter</a>.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now living in Mumbai, India, <a href="http://www.anaibharucha.com/">Anai Bharucha</a> is a fashion photography graduate from London College of Fashion. Taking her experiences in the industry in London to India, Bharucha is hoping to hit it big. In this particular shoot, the photographer focuses on sports luxe, melding a now ubiquitous London trend with her Indian heritage. The result is a colourful pastel concoction, a mixing of solid lines with soft colours and feminine tones, styled by fellow LCF alum Meagan Concessio.</p>

<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QK2x4-u-4OQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Here at P&amp;P, we invite creatives to engage in cross medium collaboration. The fashion industry involves many facets, from design to styling, make up, hair and photography. One thing we&#8217;ve really wanted to push this year has been fashion film, an emerging genre that encourages collaboration beyond the realms of just one discipline. Hats off then, to <a href="http://www.simonpetersstudio.co.uk/about-me">Simon Peters</a>, a Fashion Textiles graduate from LCF who has put together a new film, HOST, based on his AW14 collection.</p>
<p>More than a simple advertisement for his collection, Simon really uses fashion film to convey a central theme and focus. The moving image has been used to investigate a little deeper.<em> &#8216;HOST is a material based research project that was developed into a fashion film for my AW14 The Atilla Saga collection&#8217; </em>says the designer. The intention of the film is to explore Morgellons and Lyme disease, an affliction that often escapes public consciousness. Inspired by former model and dancer Laura Cherry, the film tells the story of a woman suffering from the disease. Beyond just showcasing a collection of clothing, the film has another intention.</p>
<p>The disease itself is rare and often mystified, something that clearly fired Simon&#8217;s imagination when story boarding his film. Symptoms include mysterious objects and fibres of man made origin that extrude from the skin, wiry brittle hair, and a weak immune system. Without any medical recognition of Morgellons it is very difficult to find a treatment for the symptoms, says Simon. There&#8217;s still no cure for the disease and so he hopes to raise awareness of it with his body of work. &#8221; The aim is to build awareness of the disease through a fashion outlook in an attempt to help the Morgellons community and its researchers at The Charles Holman Foundation,&#8221; says Peters.</p>
<p>Experimenting with materials including wire, metal objects, magnets and plastic was a part of creating the collection and then the film.Close up shots of the material make up the sequence of images, interspersed with longer takes of the the &#8216;host&#8217; herself. The film takes on an other worldly, sci fi feel that is symbiotically beautiful and grotesque.</p>

<p>BA Fashion Illustration student Holly Farmer has this week caught our eye with her colourfully chaotic fashion illustrations. &#8220;I am inspired by many aspects of past and current art, but predominantly I´m intrigued by the humble, every day human being,&#8221; says Holly, whose favourite artists include Egon Schiele and Lucian Freud.</p>
<p>First opting for realism in oil paint, Holly has now been experimenting with a looser form that´s more expressive. Pastel, charcoal and digital software are also used by Holly to explore the human form&#8230;</p>

<p>Inspired by our New Horizons issue and its travel slant, editor Anastasia Miari has this week been on the streets of Santiago, snapping its snappiest dressers. Trendy Bellas Artes and Bellavista areas were visited for gallery browsing and people watching, with Avenue Merced proving to be quite the hot spot for sartorially savvy  Chileans&#8230;</p>
<p>Strolling down Avenue Merced, just by Santiago&#8217;s Parque Forrestral, it&#8217;s difficult not to pause at every store window you walk past. The street is full of vintage stores &#8211; either that or small boutiques with &#8216;recycled garments&#8217;, lovingly crafted into new pieces. It&#8217;s down this street that I spotted three striking men, each with a unique style that somehow still managed to embody different aspects of the city itself. I met them all within half an hour. Lucky, as my camera was running out of battery.</p>
<p>First up was Federico Sanchez, I spotted him instantly. Green chinos, matching bow tie, shock of white hair and a cane he clearly didn&#8217;t need for walking. I left the group I was with (a city tour of Santiago could wait) and stopped him for a photo. What I hadn&#8217;t noticed in my impatience was the camera crew following him. It transpires that Sanchez is a famous architect with his own television show about the city of Santiago, which I unwittingly featured in, by pausing the main presenter mid-shoot to ask for his photo. Bit awkward.</p>
<p>Still, he was very friendly, and insisted on my taking a photograph of his bag &#8211; which is Mapuche &#8211; made by the indigenous communities of the region. Sanchez, although dandified and extroverted, a look that cropped up frequently around the Bellas Artes area of Santiago, supports the traditional Chilean crafts and techniques that go into making them, teaming staple suit combos with stand out accessories sourced from the local artisans.</p>
<div id="attachment_7305" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a ref="magnificPopup" href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/11/image1.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-7305" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/11/image1-470x465.jpg" alt="Federico Sanchez's Mapuche Bag" width="470" height="465" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/11/image1-470x465.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/11/image1-310x306.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/11/image1-300x296.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/11/image1.jpg 1097w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Federico Sanchez&#8217;s Mapuche Bag</p></div>
<p>A stroll down past the vintage stores then led me to Carlos and Alberto, owners of two vintage boutiques on Avenue Merced. They were taking a cigarette break and were more than welcoming when asked to be photographed. They happily obliged and insisted I send them a copy of Pigeons &amp; Peacocks from the UK. We have new fans in Santiago it would appear&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_7307" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a ref="magnificPopup" href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/11/image2.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-7307" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/11/image2-470x504.jpg" alt="Carlos works at Sasteria Alvevar on Avenue Merced - he posed a number of times until I got just the right shot of him and his cigarette - a great sport" width="470" height="504" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/11/image2-470x504.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/11/image2-310x332.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/11/image2-300x321.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/11/image2.jpg 1017w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Carlos works at Sasteria Alvevar on Avenue Merced &#8211; he posed a number of times until I got just the right shot of him and his cigarette &#8211; a great sport</p></div>
<p>Carlos liked to wear the clothes that come into his store, but I spotted him from across the street because of his shock of dark hair.</p>
<div id="attachment_7308" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a ref="magnificPopup" href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/11/image3.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-7308" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/11/image3-470x487.jpg" alt="Alberto owns Viejo Emperio on Avenue Merced " width="470" height="487" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/11/image3-470x487.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/11/image3-310x321.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/11/image3-300x311.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/11/image3.jpg 1056w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Alberto owns Viejo Emperio on Avenue Merced</p></div>
<p>Alberto is an old-age hippy &#8211; a vibe that definitely filters through all areas of Santiago  from the artsy neighbourhoods to down town. Although Santiago is the capital, and a busy, economically flourishing capital, it has a relaxed and insouciant atmosphere about it. Couples exchange kisses in the park for hours, business men while away break times indulging in ice creams or the city&#8217;s  favourite lunch time treat: the sandwich and even the travellers here have no real urge to DO and SEE things. Alberto for me, in his haphazard layering of accessories and uncombed locks, represented this aspect of Santiago perfectly.</p>

<p><em>The heat of the sun on your back may feel like a distant memory and a holiday is out of the question but with a little exploration, an escape from the nine ‘til five London humdrum is in sight&#8230;</em></p>
<p>Oh winter in the UK. It does little for the morale, does it? It’s cold, it’s dark. Forgetting to top up the gas meter potentially means spending an entire evening in bed so as to avert from catching pneumonia and the prospect of getting <em>out</em> of bed the next day is daunting. Add to this equation the inevitable sheet of deadly ice that covers every possible route to the bus stop and you’re looking at the most depressing time of the year. The winter blues are a force to be dealt with; especially in this economic climate but beating them is something we’ve apparently become very good at.</p>
<p>According to a recent government survey, the Office for National Statistics revealed that 73% of the country rated their happiness between a grading of 7 and 10 on the ‘happiness scale’ so we must be doing something to counter the lingering grey clouds. If you’re a part of the 27% that is yet to see the silver lining through the torrential downpours worry not, the answer may lie in entertainment. ‘In the past, in times of recession, entertainment always offered an escape. You couldn’t afford to go on holiday or buy a new car, but you could set aside a bit of money to have a treat’ says Sonia Friedman, a West End theatre producer. Not much has changed with time then because according to Friedman, the theatre industry is thriving. If escape via entertainment is the cure to our winter blues, a wealth of remedies is on offer. Theatre, art galleries, museums, independent cinema, its all an underground ride away and what’s more, it’s cheap.</p>
<p>Rather sadistically, escaping our own problems is easier when presented with someone else’s plight. Theatre and cinema provide a humane solution to this conundrum. Star cross’d lovers Juliet and her Romeo appear to suffer more in 24 hours than most of us will in an entire year and to top it all off, they die at the end. Twists and turns in plots distract from the strains of everyday life and if the play’s any good, we’ll leave the theatre thinking about that rather than the next deadline or what to make for dinner out of an onion, cheese and brown rice. Theatre has gradually become a scene for the young. A refreshing alternative to the cinema far removed from its fusty pigeon holing as the pass-time of the fur wearing, cigar-smoking bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>The Odeon may offer Orange Wednesdays but the West End is doing its best to provide cheaper tickets to shows on a daily basis. ‘It’s very important that young people and those who can’t afford to pay top prices can get in to see my shows, and I always ensure than an amount of cheaper tickets are available every day’ Friedman says. Queue for a standby ticket outside the Apollo Theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue and bag a front row seat to see the latest sell-out play for just a tenner.</p>
<p>Alison Duguid at the Society of London Theatre advises that you take a cushion though.  Discounts of as much as £70 are well worth a two-hour wait outside the box office in the cold but a bit of comfort helps in these situations. Hot choc in a flask is also a nice touch…and maybe some biscuits. For those who prefer to book in advance, many subsidised theatres like The National offer cheap ticket schemes. Apply for an <a href="http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/discover-more/entry-pass">Entry Pass card </a>for 16-25 year olds with The National and reap the benefits. This card gets you into any play for just a fiver if you book in time. ‘Finding a good deal involves digging around, but its no more complicated than booking a flight. If you phone British Airways direct, they’re going to charge the top price. But if you hunt around a bit, you’ll find an offer. There’s always a deal’ says Friedman. Kicking the blues then, is just a matter of scouting out the best bargain.</p>
<p>If times have got really hard, museums and galleries cost nothing at all. Since the introduction of universal free admission in December 2001, visits to the cultural hot spots that used to charge for entrance have tripled. If mummies and Roman artillery at the <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/">British Museum</a> gauge no interest, how do portraits of celebs and royalty (<a href="http://www.npg.org.uk/">The National Portrait Gallery</a>) or fashion’s greatest forays (<a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk/">The Victoria &amp; Albert Museum</a>) float your boat?</p>
<p>Martin Roth, Director at the V&amp;A Museum also indicates that aside from giving us something to do, museums can broaden our knowledge and even invoke the creative spirit in all of us. ‘It is important because the V&amp;A was set up to inspire creativity, knowledge and innovation, to make works of art available to all and to inspire British designers and manufacturers’ says Roth. So a wet Sunday afternoon spent dallying about a museum could result in an evening of poetry writing, a week of short story-telling, a month of dress making; a project may be just the thing to reignite your sense of get up and go.</p>
<p>Until the evenings get lighter and it’s warm enough to partake in a picnic or crack on with that morning jog before work, it may be worth donning layer upon layer of knitwear and escaping the house. A drop of culture and a dash of entertainment are just what the doctor orders to dispel sun-deprived woes.</p>

Hoping to pursue a career in fashion photography, Skahill focuses on portraiture, with a conceptual fashion angle. Think set scenes and a fairy story feel. &#8220;<span style="color: #000000">I source clothing from thrift stores and different time periods,&#8221; says Skahill. The photographer hopes to tell a story with each of her images. The worn clothes she uses add another level to that story-telling element of the photograph.</span></div>

PR</p></div>
<p>Not many designers or fashion idols have garnered as much success over the years quite like Diane von Furstenburg. Famed for the creation of the iconic &#8216;wrap-dress&#8217;, the designer has taken her brand to a new platform: a fashion reality show.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxDJ4Ut4HVE</p>
<p>Taking place in NYC, &#8216;House of DVF&#8217; will be released on 4th November on E! The eight enthusiastic contenders will be proving that they belong in the fashion world of Diane von Furstenburg. The handful of women with a passion for fashion will vie for the opportunity to be the new Global Brand Ambassador for DVF, working in marketing, design and public relations for the company. The winner will travel the world representing the brand at new store openings and press events.</p>
<p>The visionary herself stated that she wanted  &#8216;to grant young women the opportunity to become the women they want to be.&#8217; For those who have been trying for years at internships and placements in the fashion industry, you will know that this chance is kind of a big deal.</p>
<p>However, the question does arise; is this fashion reality show over-exposing the brand or opening it to a younger market? With competition reality being synonymous with light-hearted TV, one can only contemplate if this is the right move for DVF.</p>
<p>After the popularity of reality competition shows, everyone wants to tune in to see what drama the contestants get themselves into each week. And this series will have no shortage of chaos and commotion. The show is expected to receive a great deal of attention, potentially catapulting the brand to a new audience: a more youthful one. The target audience of the E! channel is a younger generation, meaning, those that watch the show will be a new consumer for Diane von Furstenburg.</p>
<p>The DVF brand seemed to have recognised the need for the TV platform such as reality show competitions, and the exposure it will bring to the company. Along with the release of the series, DVF have launched a new e-newsletter, updated their blog, and have introduced Instagram contests, all to rejuvenate the brand and appeal to a younger demographic.</p>
<p>This leads to the idea that reality shows can help project fashion brands to a new audience, and even permit for new consumers. But only time will tell if the competition show will dilute the brand quality, or boost it to a new level of popularity.</p>

<p><em>Dating in London can be tricky, but not with the right attitude and a couple of good date spots…</em></p>
<p>When you&#8217;re living in London, it’s easy to become overwhelmed by the choice of activities on offer. Evenings are filled with plans. New restaurant openings, fringe theatre, exhibitions, happy hours, magazine launch parties: it can all just get too much.  After some time in the big city, you begin to relax into the cocoon of your own Borough. You begin to retreat into your own neighbourhood, enjoying a leisurely drink at your local with familiar faces. Paying for transport is something you start to resent, and so the closer to home the better. Plus, catching three night-buses home after a night on the gin is not fun.</p>
<p>Dating becomes tricky. When you meet someone new in London, you hope that they live within your zone. If they do it’s seen as a real bonus, a sign it’s meant to be. If they live on the other side of town, the first throes of romance sometimes take a knock. Who stays at whose house on a school night? A bigger cause for concern in London, especially if the guy you’re hooking up with lives a forty minute commute away from your office. Love certainly isn’t convenient when it comes to London town. Dates must be pinned down. If you don’t make a move, there’s someone else in line waiting to.</p>
<p>Like most things in London, there’s a sense of urgency to dating. A second date must be scheduled in, so as to show that you’re interested, to hook that other person before someone else does. But the city and its rapid pace work against you. Diaries get filled quickly.</p>
<p>First dates are important and with so much choice on offer, it can be all too easy to sit back and leave the decision to someone else. Either that, or fall into the old “let’s just go for a drink after work” routine. Good after the fifth solid date, but not about to wow on a first. Whether you’re a guy or girl, it makes sense to have some good date spots up your sleeve. Be it mid-week or weekend (you know someone’s into you if they give up their Friday night with friends to take you out), there’s always something to do in the big city. It’s just a matter of finding the right spot for the right time. Break from your Borough and use that oyster card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Do Dinner and a Movie Different</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_7061" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a ref="magnificPopup" href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/10/SecretCinema.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-7061" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/10/SecretCinema-470x313.jpg" alt="Secret Cinema, Summer 2014, Photograph by Hanson Letherby" width="470" height="313" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/10/SecretCinema-470x313.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/10/SecretCinema-310x206.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/10/SecretCinema-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/10/SecretCinema.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Secret Cinema, Summer 2014, Photograph by Hanson Letherby</p></div>
<p>Sitting in silence staring at a screen is best reserved for years of marriage, in which you’ll be keen for a bit of peace and quiet. Do dinner and a movie different. There are plenty of interactive movie experiences on offer in London town, from hanging out at the latest <a href="http://www.secretcinema.org/">Secret Cinema</a> screening to lounging on couches and indulging at the bar at <a href="http://www.everymancinema.com/venues/screen-on-the-green/venue-details/">Screen on the Green</a> in Islington. Secret Cinema offers participants a chance to experience film-watching differently. Audiences are invited into the world of the film, asked to dress up and follow pre-screening clues and instructions before the event itself. Imagine the anticipation. An ice-breaker if ever there was one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Be a Tourist</p>
<p>A first date may not be worthy of a cross-town commute. Realistically, the guy or girl you met at a bar last week may not be the love of your life. They might not even be second date material. It’s a pessimistic way of looking at a fledgling romance but some of us are just realists. Take the first date then, as an opportunity to explore a part of the city that you haven’t been to. London is huge. Get them to take you on a tour of their neck of the woods, or revisit your favourite places with them, so that they get a better idea of who you are. If it doesn’t work out, you then know more date spots for future conquests (just sayin’).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Get Sloshed in Style</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_7068" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a ref="magnificPopup" href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/10/Sloshed.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7068" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/10/Sloshed.jpg" alt="Photograph by Rory DCS" width="470" height="705" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/10/Sloshed.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/10/Sloshed-310x464.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/10/Sloshed-300x450.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photograph by Rory DCS</p></div>
<p>Pints at your local sometimes just don’t quite cut it for a first date. If you want flash and swanky, head to <a href="http://aqua.com.hk/flash/#/eng/global/london/aquaSpirit/concept">Aqua Spirit</a>, just off Argyll Street for drinks and picturesque views over Regent Street and Central London. A quirky Soho cocktail is the way to go if a little tipple is required to shake off those first date jitters. Be careful though, try hard is easily detectable amongst the London-ites. For something a little more low-key, try <a href="http://freud.eu/">Freud</a>, just off Covent Garden. Plenty of irreverent cocktail mixes to get you juiced and brave enough for first date kisses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">A Walk in the Park</p>
<div id="attachment_7063" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a ref="magnificPopup" href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/10/HEath2.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-7063" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/10/HEath2-470x470.jpg" alt="Hampstead Heath, London, Photograph by Anastasia Miari" width="470" height="470" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/10/HEath2-470x470.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/10/HEath2-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/10/HEath2-310x310.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/10/HEath2-300x300.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/10/HEath2.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hampstead Heath, London, Photograph by Anastasia Miari</p></div>
<p>Hampstead Heath, in my opinion, is hands down the most romantic spot in the whole of London. Poet John Keats fell in love with Fanny Brawne there. He wrote Ode to a Nightingale there and spent days walking through this haven in the city with the woman he loved. I like to think not much has changed since then. The park is enormous and situated far enough from central London to drown out the incessant traffic buzz. Take a breather and get to know the person you’re with here, then head to <a href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/kenwood/">Kenwood House</a> for cake and tea. Picnic it in the summer and shelter together under an umbrella when it pours. It’s my favourite date spot, whatever the weather really. Cliché but completely low-key and refreshing.</p>
