				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>LCF alongside the UN Trust launched the Orange Label Project today. Professor Frances Corner, head of London College of Fashion, UAL spoke exclusively to SHOWstudio about the project and why fashion is saying NO to violence against women.</em></p>
<p><em><a href="http://showstudio.com/blog/post/fashion_says_no_to_violence_against_women">SHOWstudio </a>has kindly allowed us to republish Professor Corner&#8217;s essay below. </em></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-16089 size-large" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/11/10110_640n-470x466.jpg" alt="OrangeLabelProjectLogo" width="470" height="466" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/11/10110_640n-470x466.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/11/10110_640n-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/11/10110_640n-310x308.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/11/10110_640n-600x595.jpg 600w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/11/10110_640n.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Today is an important day. We are saying No to Violence against Women and marking the 20th anniversary of this vital work led by the UN Trust Fund to End Violence against Women (UN Trust Fund). London College of Fashion, UAL along with SHOWstudio, is proud to be using the Orange Label Project to raise awareness of this issue and we are asking the fashion industry to get behind it.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Fashion Says NO to Violence against Women has called on fashion students from across the world and across all disciplines to produce a piece of work using the colour orange. T</span>oday we intend to flood our digital realities with #orangetheworld and #Orangelabelproject. Please join us!</p>
<p>I want our industry to stop today and think about how we portray women. In our advertising, our fashion narratives, our designs and our strategies &#8211; and then we can make a powerful difference. One in three women has experienced physical or sexual violence at some point in their lives. That’s a staggering number. How often does the fashion industry question its use of the female image &#8211; women as victims, hypersexualised or two-dimensional?</p>
<p>As an industry we have a responsibility to educate a generation of strategists, designers, image-makers, and marketers and make explicit that this stereotyping isn’t acceptable. Trailblazers like All Walks Beyond the Catwalk who stand for diversity in front of and behind the lens are significant in our collective bid to see an end to this outdated and inappropriate normalising of the female image.</p>
<p>We know that raising awareness makes a difference. Some of the projects that the UN Trust Fund has been involved in are proof of this. UN Trust Fund has worked with Uganda-based organisation Raising Voices on a programme of community activities to challenge power imbalances between men and women. An independent evaluation by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found that in communities where the programme was implemented, 76 per cent of women and men believed that physical violence against a partner was not acceptable; the corresponding figure in the control communities was 26 per cent.</p>
<p>When I first met Aldijana Sisic, Chief of the UNTF, at the Women: Inspiration and Enterprise Awards last June, we talked about how London College of Fashion, UAL could support this ongoing campaign using aspects of creativity, identity and fashion. And at LCF we are working with the UN on multiple fronts, helping them to promote wellbeing, equality and safety globally. From innovative responses to the needs of women and children in the Za’atari refugee camp, to building social responsibility and sustainability into our teaching, learning and research. We stand beside the UN and their mission. It’s synonymous with our own, what we call our Better Lives agenda.</p>
<p>The first part of the Orange Label project has seen students creating work using the colour orange. This wasn’t only for fashion designers, but also stylists, journalists, film-makers, illustrators and make-up artists. And it wasn’t just for our students either; as chair of the International Foundation for Fashion and Technology Institutes, I was able to spread the word to its 54 members and make this a truly global project.</p>
<p>We were delighted to have had over 150 entries and many were group collaborations, some as large as 28, coming from all fashion&#8217;s disciplines and from students at different levels of study. We had entries from across the globe- from Nigeria, Turkey, Singapore, Australia, UK and USA.</p>
<p>What impressed me the most about the student competition was the positivity of the entries. The idea was to celebrate 20 years of the UN Trust Fund, so it wasn’t designed to highlight individual stories, or use shock tactics. The students took an ideal and made it come alive, they illustrated a world of equality where their subjects were truly empowered. We heard about their inspirations, their own stories and about how they wanted their work to influence the industry in a positive way.</p>
<p>This is the ethos that we work towards and demonstrates how London College of Fashion, UAL is shaping lives.</p>
<p>Activism is about changing the world, but it is about collective action; a social movement and a coming together of likeminded individuals.</p>
<p>There has never been a time when social movement is needed more than right now. What’s more social than social media? Seeing orange when we check our platforms today will mean people are coming together to think about, and speak out about, violence towards women and girls. Please show your support by uploading an image featuring the colour orange and using #orangetheworld and #Orangelabelproject.</p>
<p>If one other person sees your image and finds out more about the project, or if you trigger someone’s thought process, it will contribute to a collective awareness of this problem, a care to avoid stereotypes and a concern for the people around us.</p>
<p>It shows, overwhelmingly, what we can do if we stand together.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>P&amp;P <em>sits down with writer Jack Mills, Deputy Editor of </em><a href="http://www.wonderlandmagazine.com/">Wonderland</a> <em>magazine, to talk about rat-infested beginnings, pushing the creative boundaries and boozing with Mariah Carey. </em></p>
<div id="attachment_15629" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-15629" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/FullSizeRender-470x619.jpg" alt="Image courtesy of Jack Mills" width="470" height="619" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/FullSizeRender-470x619.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/FullSizeRender-310x408.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/FullSizeRender-300x395.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/FullSizeRender.jpg 759w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Image courtesy of Jack Mills</p></div>
<p><em>How and why did you get into the world of publication?</em></p>
<p>I certainly didn’t get in it to make money. My parents are both journalists, so I knew the deal from a young age. Journalism is about non-fiction storytelling – finding the story in a story. You find an interesting subject, hang out with them and discover the hook. It’s kind of like urban anthropology. I also like picking up on new youth culture crazes and movements before anyone else has had the chance to, things like Soundcloud communities, sub and counter-culture collectives and nightlife movements.</p>
<p><em>What is your approach to writing? </em></p>
<p>I almost always get anxiety before writing, because my process tends to be quite full on and draining. I put a lot into pieces and spend time working up to a lede or angle and researching the weirdest facts about subjects. As such, it can take days to sit down with something, and even when I’m into it, I’ll take massive breaks so as to keep the creative momentum going. I never tend to just “settle” into a piece, thinking about it over the course of three or four days to keep it invigorating &#8211; not to sound like a tortured dickhead…</p>
<p><em>What attracted you to working for a fashion publication?</em></p>
<p>I see <em>Wonderland </em>and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rollacoastermagazine/?hl=en"><em>Rollacoaster</em></a> more as trend publications than style magazines. With London trend magazines, there’s invariably a wider story or metaphor at hand when the focus is on young designers. They want to shout about something they’re obsessed with – like a grass roots issue or aesthetics – rather than tailoring details.</p>
<div id="attachment_15630" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-15630" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/WONDERLAND_MARIAH-e1398792147871-470x613.jpg" alt="Mariah Carey for Wonderland Magazine" width="470" height="613" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/WONDERLAND_MARIAH-e1398792147871-470x613.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/WONDERLAND_MARIAH-e1398792147871-310x404.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/WONDERLAND_MARIAH-e1398792147871-300x391.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/WONDERLAND_MARIAH-e1398792147871.jpg 520w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mariah Carey for Wonderland Magazine</p></div>
<p><em>What does being an editor of a magazine entail?</em></p>
<p>Having a point of difference: what can you, specifically you, bring to the table? Are you hilarious? Do you know more about emerging fashion or music labels than your peers? Capitalise on it: make a whole issue about labels or something. The ‘label issue’ could spotlight emerging music subgenres, the evolution of vintage clothing logos, new fashion collectives, gender labels and so on. Think about how this could sit with the issues’ graphic design cues too: maybe story titles could double as peal-away labels that readers could stick around their rooms. Themes are really important, but putting a personal stamp on your magazine is paramount.</p>
<p><em>Explain a bit more about Wonderland?</em></p>
<p>Wonderland is a youth culture and fashion quarterly. We cover pop culture in a more light-hearted, less po-faced way than some of our indie competitors. The Lana Del Rey shoot in 2011 was a perfect example of this — even though it was her first ever cover shoot, we played on her slightly concussed, pop-noirish appeal in an intentionally funny, colourful, fluffy way. <a href="http://www.wonderlandmagazine.com/2013/04/flashback-friday-lana-del-rey/">The interview was smart and sardonic too – a great read by Hanna Hanra</a>.</p>
<p><em>What do you enjoy the most about your job at </em>Wonderland<em> magazine?</em></p>
<p>Probably coming up with original features ideas, discovering new talent and putting weird spins on the classic interview profile format. It’s important to never take the same approach to a feature twice, so you&#8217;re constantly thinking up fresh ways to grab peoples’ attention. In the last issue of <em>Rollacoaster,</em> I got a writer to map out a fictional, Homer&#8217;s Odyssey-esque account of how he met members of a music collective through the night across south London – the quotes were real, though. Also, we asked a graduate illustrator to interpret what the clothing lines of cults led by a group of influential London designers would look like.</p>

<p><em>Who has been your favourite notable person you have interviewed?</em></p>
<p>Willem Dafoe was great, I interviewed him with the producers of a sci-fi film called <em>John Carter</em> before it came out. The movie turned out to be one of Hollywood’s biggest ever financial flops. I remember him saying he only ever does these big budget films to fund the experimental theatre company he runs in New York (The Wooster Group). Obviously getting mad-drunk with Mariah Carey in her hotel room for the cover of <em>Wonderland</em> was insane, as was chatting to Isabella Rossellini about her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WtftQ7AbEw">Green Porno YouTube</a> series from the London Bulgari office — with everyone listening in. I enjoyed a long, hungover morning at The (posh) Delaunay with Gwendoline Christie and Gareth Pugh, who thought I was a stray when I first walked in. Gwendoline spent the entire time swinging her sword arm over our heads a la Brienne of Tarth, her <em>Game of Thrones</em> character.</p>
<p><em>What advice would you give someone who is starting out in their career and wants to work at a magazine?</em></p>
<p>If you have a knack for hooking onto youth culture movements or trends before they snowball and have a handle on your writing style, it’s important to remain pretty resilient. Even if you’re broke, try not to worry about money at the start – work in a bar and craft your trade on the side. When I started out, I was the Deputy Editor of a start-up London culture magazine, working from a hollowed out Dickensian ex-pub in Kentish Town. I supported this by working as a cash-in-hand barman at a weekly poker night and at the pub I lived next to in Tooting, south London. When you’ve got rats running around your feet and are perched under a roof that’s bowing under the weight of snowfall, you can’t help but think, “Is this actually what I’m pushing to do?”</p>
<p><em>What do you look for in an intern?</em></p>
<p>Someone with a point of difference (which you very rarely find). When I interned, I was the one who was into extreme music, outlandish art, anything visceral and challenging. It’s important to scuff your path at a magazine without annoying anyone too much. The worst thing you can do is pitch compliantly &#8211; talents the magazine has already covered, have already had generous coverage in competitive titles or talents that fold neatly into the background. Find the angle first, then pitch.</p>

<p><em>Do you go to any talks or lectures to help students? </em></p>
<p>I’m currently working with a fashion branding, styling and photography course that Nick Knight heads up, giving students feedback on their project DNA, press strategies and how to write about your work clearly and divisively. I might explore teaching at some point, maybe a journalism course!</p>
<p><em>Other than internships, how else can students get their work out there when they graduate? </em></p>
<p>It’s not just about pitching ideas to your favourite magazines, although that’s definitely a good start. You’ve actually got to be a bit more cunning now every other person under 25 is a journalist. What areas do you want to focus on that no-one else does? Focus on developing a distinctive writing style too — are you a sarcastic writer? Funny, experimental, meta, dark?</p>
<p><em>What’s your approach to networking and collaborations?</em></p>
<p>It’s always good to talk to people, but don’t force anything. If you happen to be at the same drinks event as one of your idols, it’s probably a good idea to introduce yourself. But if the conversation doesn’t go anywhere, you probably weren’t meant to collaborate. Focus on the organic creative relationships you’ve had with someone and call them up again. If you find you can fluidly spark ideas of each other and come up with something worthwhile, you should hold onto that. Having said that, it’s good to reach out to people you want to work with over email. Cold calling is to be avoided at all costs.</p>
<div id="attachment_15633" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-15633" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/81463-800w-470x656.jpg" alt="Lana Del Rey for Wonderland Magazine" width="470" height="656" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/81463-800w-470x656.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/81463-800w-310x432.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/81463-800w-768x1071.jpg 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/81463-800w-300x419.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/81463-800w.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Lana Del Rey for Wonderland Magazine</p></div>
<p><em>Do you prefer digital or print?</em></p>
<p>I like them both for different reasons. Print will survive, but these titles won&#8217;t be where you go to find a job in journalism. All the existing main independent, commercially-owned and newsprint publications will go fully digital in the next ten years, I think. It&#8217;s pretty exciting, because the whole game is being rewritten, there&#8217;s not even time to plan it. It&#8217;s democratising all of our news media.</p>
<p><em>What has influenced your writing style?</em></p>
<p>Haruki Murikami’s stories unfold in 24-hour periods and I’ve essentially applied that to my interview style. I’m interested in approaching non-fiction storytelling using fiction writing forms. I interviewed Agyness Deyn in the back of a cab and she picked out spots we drove past on the way to her hotel, like the street the club Punk used to be on. She started reminiscing. The article ended up being about the journey, pretty much minute by minute. Elsewhere I’m into boozy writers like Patrick Hamilton and long-form New Yorker-style journalists like Sam Knight. Fiona Duncan is a great music writer too.</p>
<p><em>What lessons have learnt along the way?</em></p>
<p>Never have an argument with someone over email; never give up on a good idea and remind yourself that when it comes to putting a magazine together, artistic integrity is more important than money.</p>
<p><em>If you were not the Deputy Editor of Wonderland, what would you be doing?</em></p>
<p>Filmmaking. I&#8217;d love to make a film like<em> Naked</em> or <em>The Crying Game</em>: gritty, slightly hypnotic films that ultimately speak to you on a very human level. I think those kinds of movies are all about urban escapism, the things a big city has to offer people with a mad curiosity for life. It’s all pretty subliminal.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Hayley Christina&#8217;s illustrations are simply gorgeous. There is no other way to describe them. They blend stunning colours with striking lines and wonderful detail, and we are absolutely in love. We chatted with the rising fashion illustrator about her work, experience and plans for the future. </em></p>
<div id="attachment_14922" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-14922" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/07/pink-manolos-1-470x665.jpg" alt="Pink Manolos by Hayley Christina " width="470" height="665" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/07/pink-manolos-1-470x665.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/07/pink-manolos-1-310x438.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/07/pink-manolos-1-300x424.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/07/pink-manolos-1.jpg 707w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Pink Manolos by Hayley Christina</p></div>
<p><em>What made you decide to become a fashion illustrator?</em></p>
<p>It was strange actually – I didn’t realise I wanted to be a fashion illustrator until around a year ago, nearing the end of my second year on the course. I had always wanted to be a fashion designer. I loved making and drawing clothes and it was the fashion drawings that encouraged me to try something I hadn’t have thought of, or even knew existed. At first I felt my projects were never complete…I had so many drawings of fashion but no garment at the end – it was a very strange concept to me. With time on a fashion illustration course, I learnt the market and popularity of fashion drawing and I enjoyed doing them, so then it seemed that I did want to be a fashion illustrator. This realisation lead me into wanting to better my career and not only be a freelance illustrator but to set up my own fashion illustration related business. <a href="http://www.hayleychristina.com/">www.hayleychristina.com</a> was born earlier this year and I know I will be drawing fashions for the rest of my life.</p>
<p><em>Why do think illustration is so important to the fashion industry</em><em>?</em></p>
<p>Interpretation rather than a reality. A hand-crafted illustration shows individual flair and creativity. It demonstrates the illustrators passion for the fashion industry and particularly for the garments they are drawing. I think it is so important to represent such a massive creative industry! Fashion photography has always been fashion illustration’s key competition when a house is looking for a representation of their collections. Nowadays, we see both, collaborations, and illustrators are being commissioned as well as photographers. The appreciation for art is growing stronger again, which we can see through its popularity on social media platforms. I love Instagram &#8211; it’s great to use your profile as a portfolio and a mood board, to really give others a sense of what you’re about.</p>
<div id="attachment_14923" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-14923" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/07/Chanel-rainbow-chain-470x665.jpg" alt="Chanel bag by Hayley Christina" width="470" height="665" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/07/Chanel-rainbow-chain-470x665.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/07/Chanel-rainbow-chain-310x438.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/07/Chanel-rainbow-chain-300x424.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/07/Chanel-rainbow-chain.jpg 707w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Chanel bag by Hayley Christina</p></div>
<p><em>How would you describe your signature style?</em></p>
<p>Bold, demonstrative but not precise. I use a lot of drawing inks in my work and a heck of a lot of water. So as you can imagine, there is always a lot to try and control on the paper. I tend to use bold colours and particularly like using a mixture of colours on one illustration, or at least two so there is contrast. I always use black ink to outline and enhance parts of the illustration and to separate the art from the white background. As for what I draw, I always illustrate things that I am attracted to and inspired by. The majority of my illustrations are women accessories such as bags or shoes, which is now my specialty field.</p>
<p><em>What are your inspirations?</em></p>
<p>Colour, sceneries, interior decor and Pinterest. I look on Pinterest every day for inspiration of all things I like, which tend to be 50% fashion-related and 50% not. I also get a lot of inspiration from watching the world go by…it’s so peaceful and makes me appreciate how good life is. This always motivates me.</p>
<div id="attachment_14924" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-14924" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/07/wipe-my-face-470x665.jpg" alt="Wipe My Face by Hayley Christina" width="470" height="665" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/07/wipe-my-face-470x665.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/07/wipe-my-face-310x438.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/07/wipe-my-face-300x424.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/07/wipe-my-face.jpg 707w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Wipe My Face by Hayley Christina</p></div>
<p><em>What are your favourite materials to work with?</em></p>
<p>My favourite material to work with is drawing ink. All of my illustrations use ink and I think it gives them a unique multi-tonal edge as opposed to paints. I do use some acrylic and gouache paint when I need a deeper and thicker colour.</p>
<p><em>What’s one of your favourite illustrations that you’ve drawn?</em></p>
<p>I really love all of the illustrations I have done lately that involve illustrating a tweed fabric. I have done around four Chanel bags that are tweedette-style fabric and I love how the different colours of ink blend so well and create such a lovely detailing.</p>

<p><em>What did you enjoy most about BA Fashion Illustration?</em></p>
<p>The thing I most enjoyed about the BA Fashion Illustration degree was really just the time and chance to figure out my skills and how to apply them to create a career and name for myself. It has really opened my eyes to my future and being able to do the work that you want to do in order to better yourself is just an absolute dream. I would hate to have to stick to guidelines and be ‘ordinary’ and I think London College of Fashion understands this mantra.</p>
<p><em>Tell us about your FMP for BA Fashion Illustration.</em></p>
<p>My final major project was on of the best things I have ever accomplished because it was entirely the start up foundations for my business that is now (almost) up and running. The whole project shows the entire build up and thought process involved in creating a brand and business, which is so personal to me. I began with my favourite selection of existing illustrations from my portfolio to figure out what does and doesn’t work so that my current illustrations would be the best ones (I like to move onwards and upwards). I then used all of the illustrations I was happy with to create over 50 unique sleepwear eye mask designs. These designs were then printed onto fabric and I then hand- and machined-stitched over 50 individual eye masks using duchess stretch silk. Each eye mask has a corresponding illustrative print which is really great for people buying gifts or collecting. I then went on to design packaging and launched my live store at <a href="http://www.hayleychristina.com/">www.hayleychristina.com</a>. My FMP wasn’t the end of university – it was the beginning of my career.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;I was recently offered a place at <a href="http://www.arts.ac.uk/fashion/">London College of Fashion</a> to study <a href="http://www.arts.ac.uk/fashion/courses/undergraduate/ba-fashion-illustration/">BA Fashion Illustration</a>,</em>&#8221; says Hannah Clansey. &#8220;<em>Coming to the end of my time at college, I wanted to focus my last project on males within fashion rather than my usual stuff. I wanted to focus on gender and male stereotypes. When researching this, I found that colour played a huge part within fashion and gender. It was here I decided to look at the colour pink and its association with women. I wanted to turn this association around by showing men as females in a subtle and contemporary way. I feel the real inspiration behind this idea came from old paintings of women – something I read about in John Berger’s Ways of Seeing. Looking at these paintings I saw that women were usually inferior to men – I wanted to swap these roles in my own way using fashion.</em></p>

<p><em>I wanted my pictures to be black and white with plain backgrounds. I felt this communicated the feminine nature I wanted by making the glitter stand out.  I created these pieces by cutting different areas of the photographs out with a scalpel. I then made separate glitter pieces with a wide range of pink glitter, which I stuck behind each individual image. I took photographs of my male friends, with the exception of two, which are from magazines and one of King Krule. I decided to only use a variety of pink glitters to show the association it has with women. By using pink I discovered that I could also show unseen femininity within my work, which males aren&#8217;t always necessarily allowed to express in the eyes of society. Within my work, I also tried to communicate this by creating womanly clothing when cutting most of my images. Although I found in some images I was able to effectively convey this through vague cuttings as the pink glitter did a lot of the work.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our Illustrator of the week is <a href="http://cargocollective.com/rannycooper">Ranny Cooper</a>. We love Ranny&#8217;s approach to a &#8216;playful&#8217; subject.</p>
<p>She explains &#8220;I illustrate acts of fetish, but present them to the public in a humorous way. The fetish life isn&#8217;t all about low lit dungeons and whips (don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; it can be), however, by keeping a lighthearted quality to my illustrations I hope it will engage people who aren&#8217;t accustomed to the world of fetish.&#8221;</p>

<p>We fell in love with Alina Zamanova last year, when we featured her <a href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/2015/01/illustrator-of-the-week-alina-zamanova/">challenging and dreamlike illustrations</a> in our <a href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/tag/illustrator-of-the-week/">Illustratior of the Week</a> feature. This year, we have fallen in love with her all over again as she launches her clothing brand <em>No Concept</em> at Ukrainian Fashion Week AW16/17. As always, Zamanova&#8217;s work is bold, beautiful and provocative.</p>

<p>Zamanova, who has cut her teeth at Alexander McQueen, is making the transition from fashion illustrator to designer. She is delivering a new clothing line with accessories which she hopes will &#8220;erase the boundaries between art and fashion, ugly and beauty ideals&#8221;. We are already coveting the monochrome pinstripe pieces emblazoned with &#8216;Ugly&#8217; in a felt tip pen effect.</p>
<p>The campaign was shot by LCF alum Olesya Asanova, whose work we <a href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/tag/olesya-asanova/">featured previously online</a>, and <a href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/?s=Cammareri">Izzy Cammareri</a>. With the brand just launching, we are so excited to see more work from these LCF creatives.</p>
