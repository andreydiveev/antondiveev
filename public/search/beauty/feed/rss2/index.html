				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Ewelina&#8217;s menswear collection has been designed around the motive to install new meaning to what we think of beauty and perfection.</h3>
<p>The clothes used in this shoot were inspired by human body and it&#8217;s imperfections such as wounds, scars and medical stitches. The main goal was to use their unaesthetic values and emphasise them through irregular stitching, loose strings or dyeing. Through this process the goal was to enhance these aspects of the body into forms pleasing to the eye, persuading us to embrace the human body as it is, without alterations or &#8220;upgrades&#8221;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><em>LCF graduate Julie El-Bacha presents her </em><i>collection </i></h3>
<p><strong>&#8216;Contemporary Ophelia</strong> began with John Everett Millais’ interpretation on Shakespeare&#8217;s doomed character. The aesthetic of the painting is overwhelmingly beautiful, and yet it tells a morbid story of Ophelia’s ‘muddy death’.&#8217;</p>
<p>The sinister beauty of this painting was a concept Julie wanted her collection to embody. Millais’ masterpiece spurred her intrigue into pre-Raphaelite painting and so she studied various artists&#8217; work that also recreated a similar scene such as Krzysztof Macikowski and Slevin Aaron.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recognise any of these shoots from <a href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/home/magazine/issue-9/">P&amp;P issue 9</a>? L.A. based emerging artist Brian Burn worked his magic on them and we love the outcome.</p>
<p>Brian shares his story and creative process with us below.</p>
<p><em>I am trying to build a bridge between low brow and pop culture with bold multi media collage. My art blurs the line between the fashion industry and shades of David Lynch. It compels the viewer to notice the high art and also give the feeling that something is askew and subliminal. The beauty and the strangeness live together in harmony on the canvas. </em></p>

<p><em>I have been performing self penned rock n roll songs t in and around LA since 2012 with various projects. Self-taught in art and music, I slid into visual art in 2016 with full force. Extremely inspired by the strange, eerie, fascinating, sexual, and beautiful parts of life, I draw images from collage, mixed media, and acrylic painting at times with some digital editing. I class myself as a surrealist artist and I love  artists like Andy Warhol, Salvador Dali, Vincent Van Gogh, and Marilyn Manson to name a few. </em></p>
<p><em>I started playing with collage early on in an attempt to bring lyrics to life from my songs and writing. Fashion magazines really called out to me with their &#8216;over the top&#8217; poses and shoots. I find the fashion world imagery almost transcendental and blissful. My process of creating is an ongoing experiment of uncharted waters and it&#8217;s very soothing to me.</em></p>
<p>My plan is to continually evolve with time and fashion. I aim to show perspective and encapsulate my own soul and presence in the mean time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Freelance beauty photographer, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/joweatherleyphotography/">Josephine Weatherley,</a> talks to us about her influences and creative process.</p>
<h5><em>Tell us about yourself and what you do?</em></h5>
<p>My name is <a href="http://joweatherley.com">Josephine</a>, I am 26 and a freelance photographer. I tend to describe myself as a photographer of beauty as I think it’s easy to find something wonderful to look at regardless of what it is: fashion, beauty, product, fine art, portraiture…all of these things have amazing elements in them which I love to explore. I love photography, literature and technology &#8211; my dream is to create my own magazine that combines all these, I feel technology and science are very under-represented in a lot of women’s editorial magazines and I would like to change that.</p>
<div class=""></div>
<h5><em>Where does your artistic influence come from?</em></h5>
<div class=""></div>
<div class="">My artistic influences come from detail and structure, and the constant differences presented within these things. I was very fortunate to have parents who encouraged me artistically and exposed me to a lot of different creatives works and artists like Richard Avedon, Cecil Beaton and Robert Capa. I was a very weird person growing up and often found it a struggle to express myself, the only way I found I could free myself was through taking photographs and illustrating ideas I had in my mind, I thought it would make people understand me better but eventually it became something that was much bigger than therapy for myself &#8211; it became something that has helped shape and define me as a person, allowing me to create works of art that make my heart beat fast with happiness and making it easier to keep a passion for life. I am very unsure of my place in the world and photography gives me a purpose!</div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""></div>

<h5></h5>
<div class="">
<h5><em>What themes do you explore in your work and why?</em></h5>
<div class=""></div>
<div class="">I really enjoy photographing women as I think there is such beauty in the female form, so I like to explore how I can really bring them to life through photography and draw someones attention to how I’m currently seeing something. I adore the details in a persons face as everybodies genetic makeup is so diverse and different. When I photograph fashion I like to explore colour, shape and textures as these are very important to me when creating a successful image but when I shoot a more art based project I tend to focus on the isolation of a particular object, which I help bring forth with macro lenses and use the powerful zoom quality to show you what you may have overlooked moments ago, and maybe try and fool people into thinking they are seeing something completely different&#8230;</div>
<div class=""></div>
<h5><em>Describe your creative process.</em></h5>
<div class=""></div>
<div class="">My creative process involves a lot of listening to music &#8211; the point being to block out any other influences apart from what’s going on in my head (music is unbelievably important to me, my boyfriend James has really shown me that it&#8217;s an amazing tool for creative output and channeling my emotions when I’m struggling to be expressive). I then sketch ideas out or write in a notebook to try and visualise what it is I want to achieve. I use Pintrest a lot too as it’s a great place to look at something that&#8217;s a little more physically visual and to gain inspiration from others. I then chat with potential team members and see how we can put something in to practice, it’s incredibly important to get an outsiders perspective as they can help cement an idea or suggest something that might be even stronger &#8211; therefore creating an even better body of work.</div>
<div class=""></div>
<h5>Gold Beauty</h5>
<div class=""></div>
<div class="">I have worked with Jess on several projects and I have never met anyone who is so fantastic at turning ideas into reality, she always knows what to do even if I don’t explain it properly! This beauty design was something Jess had wanted to do for a while, it was very different from my usual shoots but I had complete faith in her that she would turn it out and that we would get something stunning and meaningful out of it. We had worked with Emily previously and we knew she was perfect for what we wanted as she is so beautiful and very relaxed when it comes to letting us try new things (she did us proud with 4 hours in makeup and more glitter than we could clean up).</div>
</div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class="">Model: Emily Tydemann</div>
<div class="">Makeup: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jesshawkinsmakeup/">Jess Hawkins</a></div>
<div class="">Swimsuit from Zara</div>
<div class=""></div>
<h5>Natura</h5>
<div class=""></div>
<div class="">This project was an amazing achievement from a concept that both myself, the designer and makeup artist came up with together: based around nature, flowers and insects. When I shot the 3 looks I wanted to convey a sense of otherworldliness without being too over the top whilst demonstrating the combined colours, textures and vividness of the overall looks. It was a challenging project but we got some amazing results and I was able to work with a whole new team of talented ladies.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fashion Photography student <a href="http://www.modelmayhem.com/portfolio/3697822/viewall">Gino Ward</a> explores the evolution of men&#8217;s fashion and beauty through history. Gino says, &#8220;My concept is inspired by 15th &#8211; 19th-century paintings of men who looked way more feminine at this time than men nowadays. The title is BOUNDARIES due to gender role which is about pushing boundaries. Since the Great Masculine Renunciation, our societal belief systems have changed. Through this project, I want to remind people that since the medieval period, male clothing was always more interesting, innovative and less conservative than women&#8217;s. The present pervasive excitement about men wearing feminine clothes and items only shows how deeply we still believe in symbolically separating the clothes of men and women.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Imagine a world where fashion is fair.&#8221; That is the rallying cry from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/isusseditout/">SUSS UK</a> founders Emma Grace Bailey and Abigail Grainger.  UAL almuna, the journalist and fashion designer respectively have launched a Kickstarter to fund their upcoming pop-up concept store which will promote a sustainable lifestyle with ethical, environmentally and human friendly brands.  The store will also raise awareness around the issues of sustainability in the fashion industry and provide insight into the problems fast fashion causes, and provide solutions to the problem.</p>
<div id="attachment_16727" style="width: 582px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-16727" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/03/kickstarter-poster-fashion-with-a-conscience-572x750.jpg" alt="SUSS UK Kickstarter flyer " width="572" height="750" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/03/kickstarter-poster-fashion-with-a-conscience-572x750.jpg 572w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/03/kickstarter-poster-fashion-with-a-conscience-381x500.jpg 381w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/03/kickstarter-poster-fashion-with-a-conscience-600x787.jpg 600w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/03/kickstarter-poster-fashion-with-a-conscience.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">SUSS UK Kickstarter flyer</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what spurred Abi and Emma to take action? Well they are concerned about the irreversible damage being caused by our excessive levels of consumption. Over the last five years, the fast<br />
fashion industry has grown exponentially, with the top five retailers growing 9.7 per cent year on year. Brands churn out an average of 52 micro collections a year, and with higher production<br />
levels comes higher consumption, resulting in a quantity of waste that the planet can no longer deal with. In just one year, the clothes discarded in the UK alone could fill Wembley stadium, the equivalent of 1.5 million tonnes of landfill every 365 days.</p>
<p>Sustainability is not a trend. It is a necessary step which the fashion industry must take for the future of our planet. At present, both the industry and the consumer are moving too slowly, but there are a growing number of brands who are paving the way with innovative solutions to material waste, supply chains, production and sourcing. Supported by a growing number of consumers who are becoming more conscious and looking at their options.</p>
<p>SUSS UK is dedicated to further raising this awareness, and firmly believe that the secretive nature of the fashion industry needs to stop. All consumers deserve to know exactly what they’re<br />
buying. But this is not about preaching. SUSS UK love fashion, they just want fashion to be kind as well as beautiful.</p>
<p>The first of its kind store will run throughout September 2017 and stock global womenswear, menswear, kidswear, homeware, beauty and food &amp; drink brand. SUSS UK will show that sustainabilty is an entire lifestyle not just a fad. There will also be a series of talks with industry heavyweights giving insight into their sustainable life and interactive workshops giving consumers a hands-on experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/721490866/fashion-with-a-conscience?ref=project_link">SUSS UK need to raise £10,000 by 1st May 2017</a> and are looking for donors. Get involved and support this worthy initiative.</p>
