				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hanna Puskarz, photographer and one half of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/handzaround/">@HandZaround</a> interviewed <a href="https://www.lalaloveworld.com">Lalalove</a> founder and designer, Linda Choroenlab during her world travels.</p>

<p><strong><em>How did Lalalove start? We read on you blog that it all started in London, </em><em>at the Portobello Road Market.</em></strong></p>
<p>Do you wanna have the real real story, or made up story to make it sound good?</p>
<p><strong><em>The real one!</em></strong></p>
<p>There are two stories &#8211; one is the good one and one is the real one. The real one starts from [the moment of my] study at LCF. I was studying styling and photography and actually, I really wanted to be a stylist. At the time I worked in a Thai restaurant. Like everyone in London, you needed to work part-time to pay the rent… or to do whatever.</p>
<p>When I worked in a Thai restaurant, it wasn’t related to what I wanted to do at all, and it wasn’t really bringing me anything. I managed to get a job at Gucci during the period I was studying styling and photography. After that, when I graduated, I worked in Moschino in visual merchandise. I didn’t want to do that, however it was related to my subject, but I thought it was better than doing anything else. I still wanted to be a stylist, so I did lots of test shoots and I worked as an intern at Dazed and Confused. But it was all for free, you didn’t get paid. I did lookbooks for Maria Francesca Pepe, Gareth Pugh…but we never got paid…</p>
<p><strong><em>Such big people and they don&#8217;t have money…</em></strong></p>
<p>Really big people and they don&#8217;t get that I need to work in the shop to earn something. I was like ‘Hey, what I earn is not enough, after I pay the rent, I struggle a lot!’ So I was thinking what can I do to have more time, to do styling, to earn money… I am not a designer, but I thought I could maybe design a t-shirt. I sent a file to Bangkok, so they could do a silk screen print for me on a tshirt, and they sent it back here, to London. That was the beginning of my career as a designer. I didn’t really consider myself a designer, because I felt I was a stylist, but I thought I could do it as a hobby.  I tried to get a store in Portobello Market, but it was really difficult to get one because they have a system there, similar to one in the mafia… You need to pay cash to the people; you need to wait in the queue. I pretended to be a really innocent Thai girl…and I got the stall! I started to sell there regularly, but it was so tough! I didn’t sell the t-shirts for cheap. I designed the prints myself so I charged about £20 for a t-shirt. After some time, I also opened a stall in the Spitalfields Market. I worked every Saturday and Sunday and it was really hard. People of the new generation don&#8217;t understand how hard it is… They think everything so easy. You don&#8217;t have any money, you have two big suitcases you have to get on the bus, then wait in the queue for your stall, and you might get the stall on the day or not…you don&#8217;t even know. It just turns out at the spot. You just have to wait for the decision because you are new.</p>
<p><strong><em>So how did it all evolve into more than selling at the stall?</em></strong></p>
<p>After some time I had Japanese buyers come to buy in Portobello in wholesale. I didn’t even know what wholesale was. It was a learning process. After a year, a distributor from Italy came across my stall. They wanted to resell my t-shirts. I didn’t know much about it but I was lucky &#8211; I was able to turn to my friends. In the end, my t-shirts were selling at a department store in Italy for about €80 each! So I quit Moschino because I had enough money to do styling for free.</p>
<p><strong><em>So how did that all work out after you quit Moschino?</em></strong></p>
<p>It was good! I did a lot of styling and eventually I got an offer to be a fashion editor for Wallpaper Magazine, Thai edition. I did that also for Dazed &amp; Confused Japan, everything was going okay.</p>
<p>Then I had a baby, Lulu. After I gave birth, it was difficult because I didn’t have my family to be with me all the time. My husband’s family came to see us<br />
once or twice a week but it was different to the Thai culture &#8211; Asian family helps you a lot with taking care of the baby. I couldn’t do styling because I had to take care of Lulu, so my family suggested moving back to Thailand for a while. My family really supports my career and so I decided to move back for a while. It meant I could do collections and hire people to help me so I can also do styling. In the meantime my family helps me with taking care of Lulu whilst my husband, Mark, who is a musician, goes back and forth every 6 weeks between England and Bangkok.</p>
<p><strong><em>So how did it all move on since you returned to Bangkok?</em></strong></p>
<p>At the beginning it was just ok. But then lots of things started to happen &#8211; working as a stylist, billboards for departments stores, magazines. Then Topshop noticed <em>Lalalove</em> and we were selling in Topshop in London’s Oxford Street for three years. We don’t do it anymore though. It’s too much going on here! I now have a <em>Lalalove</em> store in Siam Paragon Shopping Centre.</p>
<p><strong><em>So that’s how Lalalove was born! Did you have to change your audience </em><em>when you moved to Bangkok? In the UK the fashions are different than </em><em>here.</em></strong></p>
<p>Actually, I never compromise with my style at all. In Siam Center, mainly tourists buy my things, Chinese or European. But actually I don&#8217;t care. If Thai people don&#8217;t buy it, I don&#8217;t give a damn, I&#8217;m not going to pretend to sell lace or pastels. I would get so bored.</p>
<p><em style="font-weight: bold">You don&#8217;t need to compromise! It seems like there is a whole new audience for you now!</em> <strong><em>What are you inspirations? Lalalove looks so colourful, and full of life.</em></strong></p>
<p>I really love positive things. Actually I love nature and I love animals. I love flowers. I Really want to be positive and colourful because at the moment the world is stressful enough. I don’t want to be bothered with all that shit! I want to be nice and colourful, and make people smile. This is my brand.</p>
<p><em style="font-weight: bold">Can you tell us about the Pa Kao Ma Collection? I love that it is inspired </em><em style="font-weight: bold">by the Thai culture. You use original Thai fabrics produced in rural areas.</em> <strong><em>Can you tell us some more about that?</em></strong></p>
<p>Yes! The government contacted me. They do collaborations with high fashion Thai brands, but usually with the very traditional ones. And they asked me to collaborate with them, I don&#8217;t know what on earth they were thinking!</p>
<p><strong><em>But you agreed, and it all worked out! What was it all about?</em></strong></p>
<p>Deep in my heart I really like nature, so I want to be sustainable. But this project was supposed to be just for the fashion show. In Thailand we have artists and designers, who collaborate just for the fashion shows and then the projects are over. I really disagree with it, because it&#8217;s such a waste of time. When I got the collaboration offer, I started to research why Thai people don’t buy traditional Thai silk anymore. Why does the new generation not wear it? What’s the problem?<br />
The government pays the designers money to do the fashion show and then it’s all in press and that’s it. And then what, they promise to the village to buy Thai silk, they give them money once but do they ever buy more? Do they buy every month? The villagers really hope to improve their situation and if they get paid only once it doesn’t really keep the Thai economy growing.</p>
<p>I expressed my opinion and tried to talk to them, but because it’s their idea I couldn’t say much to change it. We were almost finished with the collection for the fashion show and then the next day the King passed away…I then got a call from the government that the project will be cancelled. I told them ‘why cancel’? They already spent a lot of money and I made the collection.<br />
They said we can’t go on with the fashion show because the King passed away. I tried to prove them that this is not what the King would want. He wouldn’t want them to spend all this money for nothing. I suggested spending the rest of the money not on the fashion show but on doing a look book, PR and spreading the word, because we worked very hard on making this combination of sustainable Thai fabric and quirky street wear… We went to the village by ourselves to talk to the people, who make the fabric, who yarn. They only do it part-time because it doesn’t bring them enough money. So they work as farmers the rest of the time. However, if we ordered every month or two, this could become their full-time career. So I said to the government ‘If you want to cancel, I will still charge you 100%.’</p>
<p><strong><em>Did the fashion week happen?</em></strong></p>
<p>No, the fashion week didn’t happen but it’s actually good because I could use the money to do a really nice look book and towards the trade show abroad, not just in Thailand. We’re going to Japan for Tokyo Fashion Week.<br />
I think the more Thai people can see our collection showcased abroad, the more they will consider it cool and will go back to support it. If we got Pa Kao Ma to sell in a store abroad, people in Thailand would want to wear it themselves. They would be inspired by the fashion abroad &#8211; Paris, London, Berlin, wherever. So getting Pa Kao Ma there would help the young Thai generation to see that this is not fucked up, this is cool and you can wear it!<br />
I am not religious and I don’t go to temples, but this is what I can do for my country. I love my country and this is what I can do, being myself.</p>
<p><strong><em>Change the world in your own way!</em></strong></p>
<p>Exactly, in my own way. There are 1000 villages in Thailand, I am the only brand, who started to work with them. I cannot use fabrics from all the 1000 villages but if you’re a new designer, don’t fly to Paris to see ‘the best world’. Go to Chiang Rai first. See what they have. Economy will grow! Thai people need to be together to help each other. Not just think ‘Paris is fucking cool’. No!</p>
<p><strong><em>What do you consider to be your biggest achievement?</em></strong></p>
<p>My biggest achievement is happiness. I don&#8217;t need lots of money. The happiness comes from people wearing my clothes and using them to express themselves. And another thing is having more time with my daughter.</p>
<p><strong><em>So when you see someone walking on the street wearing your clothes,</em> <em>what do you do?</em></strong></p>
<p>I run and hug them, and say: ‘Thank you, thank you! OMG thank you! Can I take a picture with you!’. I am so over the moon. I think I will be like this forever.</p>
<p><strong><em>What has been the biggest difficulty on your journey?</em></strong></p>
<p>Dealing with people! Always people!</p>
<p><strong><em>How do you deal with the people who are on different wavelength than</em> <em>you in the fashion world?</em></strong></p>
<p>I try to close my eyes. If the money is not good to deal with, I don’t deal with it. No time for drama. It&#8217;s good though, because in my industry I have my good friends. We see a lot people, who are really selfish in fashion, and in other fields. They&#8217;ve got to survive, but don&#8217;t do too much. Everyone wants to be rich and take advantage so much. But you need to be a role model!</p>
<p><strong><em>What about sustainability? Last time we met, you said you’re working on </em><em>your collection to be sustainable. Were you always sustainable?</em></strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;re sustainable in like 70%, which is good as this is the first collection. I did my best, but I think we’ll improve with every collection. A couple percent more with each one. In my factory, I check myself what they do. It&#8217;s not sweat &amp; tears. That&#8217;s why the price is not cheap. It&#8217;s not unreachable though. If someone asks me why [something from Lalalove] is not 100 baht…the fabric is 400 baht, plus shipping to Bangkok, plus my work, plus pay for people sewing, plus I need to pay VAT. I can&#8217;t say that though…so, I just smile. I say that to myself. On the outside I am smiling, but I&#8217;m thinking &#8216;Just fuck off&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong><em>We found the older generation of Thais to be very traditional and </em><em>conservative so when we first saw your stuff, we thought ‘Wow, that&#8217;s </em><em>different!’ Where do you think the fashion industry in Thailand is at?</em></strong></p>
<p>I think Thailand can do very well. I think that Thailand is actually the best of South East Asia already. But the price point is&#8230; We are in the middle, which is such a shame. We are between H&amp;M &amp; Zara and Gucci &amp; Louis Vuitton.<br />
People see us because we are doing so much hard work, and they do think it’s good, yet they choose to buy H&amp;M. Or they choose to buy Zara. Let’s say in Zara the dress is about 3000 baht, the dress from a Thai designer is 8000 baht. But, if they are to spend 8000, they prefer to buy something from Paris, which is 16,000 baht. They appreciate the name, or the tag &#8216;made in Paris&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong><em>What has made you successful? What makes a good designer? Why do </em><em>you think you are at the point you are at now?</em></strong></p>
<p>I think because I have my positive attitude and I don’t give up. I keep going and try to find my happiness. I&#8217;m not going to do something that makes me unhappy, because I don’t just want a number in the bank. I can go on a cheap holiday! I don&#8217;t need to be in luxury all the time…just sometimes I need it, haha!</p>
<p><strong><em>How do you imagine LaLaLove’s future?</em></strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t need to be a too big of a company. I want to know everyone and be close to everyone in my brand. And talk, and drink and have dinner with everyone, who works with me. I want everyone to be happy.</p>

<p>The third instalment in Hoxton Mini Press&#8217; &#8216;<em>Tales of the City&#8217; </em>series, London Youth is a powerful series of portraits of inner-city teenagers alongside their thoughts on modern life.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Mährlein, an LCC alum, was inspired to start the project in the wake of the 2011 riots – he wanted to try to show the other side of inner-city teenagers that were so criticised by the media. He wandered the city, approaching young people who caught his eye, photographing them in an uncontrived way. The series was shot with natural light and mostly in urban environments where they play football, basketball, skate or cycle.</p>
<p>Below are a selection of the images presented in the book.</p>

<p>LONDON YOUTH is published by <a href="https://www.hoxtonminipress.com">Hoxton Mini Press</a>, the east London based independent publisher specialising in photobooks. Available from today, Thursday 20th April, priced £17.95.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Museum of Transology exhibition has been on display at LCF&#8217;s <a href="http://www.fashionspacegallery.com/">Fashion Space Gallery</a> for the past few months and it closes on April 22, so now is your last chance to go and check it out. The exhibition hosts the largest collection of trans artefacts and photographs ever to be displayed in the UK, and shows the many realities of modern trans life, whilst also posing a bigger question about the omission of trans lives from larger national museum collections.</p>

<p>After Fashion Space Gallery, the exhibition will be on display in Brighton Museum, from July 2017 until summer 2018. In an <a href="http://bit.ly/2pbwpp3">interview with LCF News</a>, the curator of the exhibition E-J Scott said:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the most wonderful things for me has been that at the end of the exhibition, there’s a hat rack coming out of the wall where everyone can leave a message, and it’s heaving with tags from people writing comments. What’s interesting is that it’s clear that it has become an exhibition that’s about more than trans, it’s about gender and about how gender roles affect everyone’s lives. It’s been hitting people personally whether they are trans or not, and for me that’s very interesting.</p></blockquote>
<p>He spoke about how the exhibition will be expanded at Brighton:</p>
<blockquote><p>There’s going to be new sections when it goes there – the way the the exhibition is formed at the moment, is that we tackled major issues affecting trans communities. In the new exhibition, the crux of the show will be the same, but we will have add on sections, and we will also engage with the permanent collection at the Brighton museum too, and explore the way objects within this, can represent people’s non normative gender experiences. We’ll hopefully use some items out of the costume collection for example, and look at fashion and gender. It’s going to be bigger, bolder and tackle new issues.</p></blockquote>
<p>The exhibition is on at Fashion Space Gallery until 22 April. It opens to the public at Brighton Museum on 20 July. You can follow Museum of Transology on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MuseumofTransology/">Facebook </a>and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/museumoftransology/">Instagram</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.scarlettshaney.com/">Scarlett Shaney Langdon</a> is a photographer, writer, zine-maker and graduate from BA Fashion Photography at London College of Fashion. Her work explores themes of queer femininity, digital cultures, performativity and female identity.</p>
<p>Her work, <strong>In real life</strong>, took the form of a zine and series of web pages exploring female identity online and the way women represent and perform femininity in our 21st century internet culture.</p>

<p>Scarlett told us:</p>
<p>&#8216;This project was for my Final Major Project on BA Fashion Photography where I looked at online identities, and the way in which women perform identity online. For each subject I photographed I incorporated elements of their online identity into the image by using screenshots, iPhone imagery, and collaging elements from their social media accounts. I then contrasted this with stripped back portraits of the subject at home in their bedroom, shot on 35mm film. This juxtaposition serves to emphasise the performative nature of social media, and how women in particular use this to experiment, play and curate how they are seen.&#8217;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK nightclubs and its music scene are in the midst of a transitional period, some argue the scene is dying and the authorities are actively hacking away at one of our most successful exports, others say we are embarking on a creative awakening, what&#8217;s certain is that everything is changing.</p>
<p>We took this opportunity to talk to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/waxwingsofficial?ref=br_tf">Wax Wings</a> to hear his views on the scene, and his rise from the capital&#8217;s underground gay dance scene to touring with Maya Jane Cole and performing at London&#8217;s newest mega-venue Printworks this month.</p>
<div id="attachment_16298" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-16298" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli.jpeg" alt="Processed with VSCO with a6 preset" width="1000" height="670" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli.jpeg 1000w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-500x335.jpeg 500w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-768x515.jpeg 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-750x503.jpeg 750w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-600x402.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Processed with VSCO with a6 preset</p></div>
<p>Wax Wings, or Joseph Icaro, depending on how well you know him, is an artist in the truest sense. Familiar with the small Gothic town of Whitby in Yorkshire? Nope, us neither. But it&#8217;s where Wax was born to his dad, a Brazilian musician originally from Bahia, and his mother, a British artist. He moved to London to study Fine Art at UAL&#8217;s Camberwell, and it was there that he realised creating music was what he wanted to do. He also did some modelling for LCF Design friends and reckons he might be in a previous Pigeons &amp; Peacocks issue.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-16299 aligncenter" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/13600071_605174442975385_4124759036144273255_n.jpg" alt="13600071_605174442975385_4124759036144273255_n" width="768" height="960" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/13600071_605174442975385_4124759036144273255_n.jpg 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/13600071_605174442975385_4124759036144273255_n-400x500.jpg 400w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/13600071_605174442975385_4124759036144273255_n-600x750.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p>So where does the name Wax Wings come from we ask? This wasn&#8217;t always the name he worked under (&#8220;let&#8217;s not go into that&#8221;, he says). He use to work under a different name, one shared by another artist, whose been on Radio 1 several times. He explained that his friends kept on raving about hearing him on radio, and he had to keep on saying that wasn&#8217;t him. He needed something new, so he decided to use his last name Icaro &#8211; which means Icarus, who is the famous son from Greek mythology that travels to the sun. Basically, Icarus flew too close to the sun with the wings his father constructed from feathers and wax, which melted, plummeting Icarus to his death in the sea below. So wings of wax – that’s where the name derived from.</p>
<div id="attachment_16300" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-16300 size-full" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-3.jpeg" alt="for-the-below-credit-alexandre-paganelli-3" width="1000" height="669" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-3.jpeg 1000w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-3-500x335.jpeg 500w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-3-768x514.jpeg 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-3-750x502.jpeg 750w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-3-600x401.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Alexandre Paganelli.</p></div>
<p>Wax was already involved in music before moving down south. &#8220;Well, I started DJ&#8217;ing in my hometown – in a really shit pub. There wasn’t really a scene for it in the town I grew up in so I kind of moved it over to Leeds. I sort of dipped my toes in the hard dance scene there. There’s a really good music scene in Leeds at the moment. But the music didn’t really start until I moved down to London in 2011. I got wrapped up in the gay music scene in London with Larry Tee and some of the influential characters from the 80s in New York&#8221;, he explains.</p>
<p>Wrapped up in the scene, what do you mean? &#8220;I came to London like everyone else trying to find themselves. I was dressing crazy and got lured into those kinds of parties. Larry gave me a chance, we then started playing with each other. We sort of bounced off each other which was really fun&#8221;, he tells us. Do you still play together? He says no, &#8220;He’s now moved to Berlin though so we don’t see each other that much anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F269190614&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=1500&#038;maxheight=1000"></iframe></p>
<p>Larry and Wax played the underground gay scene together for a while, before playing more and more gigs independently. He met his music manager at one of his first club gigs &#8211; originally he thought it was the most unlikely place to meet his music manager Steven. But he says, &#8220;Knowing him now, it couldn&#8217;t have happened any other way.&#8221; That&#8217;s how Wax joined the Weird &amp; Wonderful family, which includes industry giants like Justin Martin, Catz &#8216;N&#8217; Dogz and Maya Jane Coles. Past clients also include Italian duo Tale of Us, and Magda just to name a few.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything is amazing! Absolutely all of it. I think I got very lucky with this gig&#8221;, he says on the label. Wax then dropped his EP, which got a lot of support from some of the industries biggest artists like Leftfield and George Fitzgerald. We asked him how that made him feel? &#8220;It’s amazing to open up your promo report and to see these amazing people you went to see at gigs or shows supporting your music. Seeing these big names understanding what I’m trying to do and create is just amazing. Such a great feeling! It’s really humbling which is always good.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F298458817&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=1500&#038;maxheight=1000"></iframe></p>
<p>We ask if he wants to achieve the same fame and status as Leftfield and George Fitzgerald. He said, &#8220;I don’t want to pigeons and peacock hole myself ha. I want to be really open! I want to do a lot of different things – there’s a lot more to show than being a headline DJ.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wax is a humble guy, he says he gets that from his parents, but it&#8217;s refreshing to hear an emerging artist not wanting to headline Lovebox or clubs in Ibiza.</p>
<p>So what does he want? A record label? International fame? A residency at fabric or Berghain? Yeah of course! But he also wants to move to Japan. Look at any of Wax&#8217;s social media accounts and you&#8217;ll notice three flags. One British and Brazilian, flags that represent his heritage, and a Japanese one, a country he says he&#8217;s adopted.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16301" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/13641183_609357069223789_2520909567707245995_o-e1486391393965.jpg" alt="13641183_609357069223789_2520909567707245995_o" width="1000" height="1248" /></p>
<p>He&#8217;s been to Japan a few times, most recently touring with Maya Jane Coles. How was the trip, we ask. &#8220;<span class="TextRun SCX263453644" lang="EN-US"><span class="NormalTextRun SCX263453644">Oh don’t get me started on Japan. You will not shut me up! It’s the best place in the world. It has the best food and people, everything about it is perfect. I was out there for three weeks touring. We played at Circus in Tokyo and then we went down to Osaka and played Circus again, which definitely won out of both venues. Osaka was incredible! It was absolutely amazing. I’ve been to Japan twice but never made it to Womb, but hopefully in the next trip in April we want to swarm in.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCX263453644" lang="EN-US"><span class="NormalTextRun SCX263453644">What was the best part? He says, &#8220;<span class="TextRun SCX232945953" lang="EN-US"><span class="NormalTextRun SCX232945953">You think you’d want to go into the cities while in Japan, but I’m super obsessed with their culture so I like to going out and seeing </span></span><span class="TextRun SCX232945953" lang="EN-US"><span class="NormalTextRun SCX232945953">real Japan</span></span> <span class="TextRun SCX232945953" lang="EN-US"><span class="NormalTextRun SCX232945953">in the countryside, temples, and </span></span><span class="TextRun SCX232945953" lang="EN-US"><span class="NormalTextRun SCX232945953">Kyoto was amazing.&#8221; </span></span> </span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BC8iOmRLEsu/">https://www.instagram.com/p/BC8iOmRLEsu/</a></p>
<p>He&#8217;s also obsessed with Japanese fashion and people. During one of his visits, he played a gay party in Tokyo called <em>Fancy Him.</em> Wax believes in London, well sometimes, fashion is used powerfully to say &#8216;look at me&#8217; and this is what I&#8217;m about, but the substance behind that look doesn&#8217;t always translate. In Tokyo, it&#8217;s very different. &#8220;Everyone just seems effortlessly cool in Japan&#8221; and they act normal instead of trying to say something.</p>
<p>We start discussing musicians creating their own clothing lines and taking creative control of every aspect of their careers. So where do you stand with clothing lines for your record label? &#8220;If it looks good then why not, I&#8217;m 100% behind that! I mean artists creating t-shirts is one thing, I&#8217;m not sure if you can call that fashion, but if you do it right – offer something with usual cuts and patterns, not just  a record label emblem. If you&#8217;re going to do it and label yourself as fashion, then be fashion, not merchandise.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_16302" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-16302 size-full" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-2.jpeg" alt="Processed with VSCO with a6 preset" width="1000" height="670" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-2.jpeg 1000w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-2-500x335.jpeg 500w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-2-768x515.jpeg 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-2-750x503.jpeg 750w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-2-600x402.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Alexandre Paganelli.</p></div>
<p>And he&#8217;s right. The industry is changing, people are now streaming or illegally downloading instead of buying records and albums. Creating a clothing line is an obvious way to generate economic growth &#8211; but don&#8217;t just print overpriced merchandise and label it a brand. We then start discussing how the DJ experience needs to evolve alongside the industry.</p>
<p>Wax believes the experience can be heightened. &#8220;I think we can be playing more than just records after records. I think there should an element of performance in there to keep it fresh. When you go to Secret Garden Party, there was stage performances and visuals to go with every set, I think the scene needs more of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>So how do you do that we ask? &#8220;I played at Egg London once and brought my friend down to create BfX visuals for the night. I think there needs to be more little things like that improve the live experience. You can expand your horizons, it&#8217;s a stage, you should be offering more on the stage than records. I guess I&#8217;m thinking this because my album is so different to the club stuff, it&#8217;s more of a live experience. I saw Massive Attack last year, they expressed their political stance and more emotion than just listening to songs through their show.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F294564783&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=1500&#038;maxheight=1000"></iframe></p>
<p>Politics has been on the tip of most people&#8217;s tongue the last year. We&#8217;ve had a supercharged year that saw a rise of nationalism through Trump and Brexit alongside the western world&#8217;s first Muslim major city mayor in Sadiq Khan. We wanted to know where Wax stood politically?</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s (politics) been shaken up. I wasn&#8217;t that bothered before but now I feel more engaged. There&#8217;s been a lot of things that have hit more close to home as a person, artist, gay guy, and my moral values – I guess it&#8217;s ruffled my feathers. It&#8217;s shaken me up a little as a gay mixed-race guy, that&#8217;s two minorities that feel under attack. It feels a bit close to home! I feel like I need to use my voice and music to say something now.&#8221;</p>
<p>His new album, Umbilical, is very different to his previous material. He says it&#8217;s more mysterious and dark, instead of having a club feel, it&#8217;s more of a live album. His music spans across genres, from trip-hop to techno, and breakbeat to house, so we&#8217;re expecting something very unique. DJ Mag also draw many similarities between his productions and the work of Aphex Twin, Massive Attack and Tricky &#8211; naturally, we&#8217;re excited to hear the new material.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BP8NUWVAVQo/">https://www.instagram.com/p/BP8NUWVAVQo/</a></p>
<p>We finish off by discussing where dance music and clubbing culture is today, especially for spectators. Everyone knows that nightlife is taking a pounding at the moment in the UK. Cultural institutions and club environments where new ideas begin and where people met are closing in almost every town and city. There was some light at the end of 2016 for London when fabric reopened and news of Printworks surfaced, we ask him if we&#8217;re going through a crisis or creative awakening?</p>
<p>&#8220;I think both. It’s incredible to see what happens when a community comes together like dance music did for Fabric. But you can also see what happens when a community falls apart at the same time. Because things start getting neglected and it allows for Fabric and other places to close. It just makes me excited that I might actually get to play there one day, it’s no longer off the cards yet&#8221;, he tells us.</p>
<p>Wax Wings is performing at Printworks on <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/event.aspx?911133">18 February alongside Maya Jane Coles and Alan Fitzpatrick</a>. He will also be hosting three dates at Dalston Superstore this year.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>In 1985, The Sun newspaper printed the following joke: “Mom, I’ve got good news and bad news. The bad news is I’m gay. The good news is I’m dying.” By then, the AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) epidemic and hysteria was full blown with 20,303 cases globally. The virus, which had claimed a few sporadic cases in the 70s, had aggressively manifested into a worldwide terror, nicknamed by the media as ‘ gay cancer’ and preached as the Lord’s comeuppance on a sinful homosexual community. Thankfully, we have come along way since then. </em></p>

<p><strong>Why is it that 1 in every 20 gay and bisexual men in the UK is living with HIV and the numbers are increasing?</strong></p>
<p>Medical research into HIV and AIDS is at its most advanced, with continual breakthroughs in prevention and treatment and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) has become a lifelong illness rather than an immediate death sentence. As yet, there is no cure for HIV or AIDS.The older generation lived through the AIDS epidemic and came out the other side, fully aware of what the virus can do. They survived the despite the lack of information and awareness. We are lucky, now, to have all the information that we need at our fingertips. So why is it that 1 in every 20 gay and bisexual men in the UK is living with HIV and the numbers are increasing? 1 in 5 of this number is currently unaware of his HIV+ status. In London, 1 in every 11 gay and bisexual men is HIV+. Men who have sex with men represent almost 55% of those diagnosed with HIV. Rates continue to rise while behaviours remain unchanged and attitudes seem to show complacency.</p>
<p>In London, mayor Sadiq Khan spoke in early 2016 about the dangers of a relaxed attitude towards HIV after statistics revealed a disproportionate number of Londoners living with the virus. In 2014, London accounted for 45% of the total HIV diagnoses in England, with 30 out of 32 London boroughs showing a higher than average HIV rate. Speaking to gay publication <a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/01/11/sadiq-khan-londons-record-on-lgbt-hate-crime-is-a-badge-of-shame/">PinkNews</a>, Khan said: “<em>These statistics show a huge rise in the prevalence of HIV+ in London, and behind each of these statistics is a story of human suffering and sadness. While treatment for HIV sufferers has improved rapidly over my lifetime, we can’ t afford to be complacent about HIV prevention.”</em></p>
<p>Speaking of the rise of diagnosed cases,<a href="https://twitter.com/DoctorChrisVT?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"> Dr Chris van Tulleken</a>, a virologist at UCL, who is behind the BBC documentary The Truth About HIV, accredits increased testing and available facilities for the growth in figures but also a “decrease in awareness in many communities. There is now a generation of sexually active men and women who did not grow up with HIV as a death sentence and so they’re less concerned, take fewer precautions and end up more at risk.”</p>
<p><strong>Prevention rather than cure</strong></p>
<p>PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) is a daily pill which greatly reduces the person’ s risk of HIV infection. It contains two medicines that are used in HIV treatment, so if a user is exposed to HIV, these medicines work to combat the virus and prevent infection. PrEP is offered to HIV- people whose behaviour puts them at risk of HIV or someone who is in a relationship with an HIV+ person. PrEP users must commit to seeing their health care provider every three months for a check up. The drug has been shown to reduce the risk of HIV infection in people at high risk by up to 90% and is currently in use in countries such as France, Australia, Canada and the US.</p>
<p>Dr van Tulleken supports the availability of the drug. “PrEP is great. It makes total economic and medical sense. It prevents spread and diminishes the risk of resistant virus emerging. It reeks of homophobia that it is taking so long to make it widely available.”And it is taking far too long. With all the potential offered in PrEP in stamping out HIV, it is wonder that in May 2016, NHS England voted against offering the drug. The decision however has been successfully challenged in court by the<a href="http://www.nat.org.uk/"> National AIDS Trust</a>.</p>
<p>In a bid to further prevent the rate of infection, there are calls for dating apps to provide sexual health advice and offer free condoms to their users. There is no evidence directly linking dating apps to increased HIV rates, however they are a factor which must be considered. The globally popular gay app Grindr is encouraging its one million plus active users across 192 countries to get tested and provides information about local testing centres.</p>
<p>LCF alum Jacob Alexander was diagnosed with HIV on his 22nd birthday. Speaking at a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOVRVcOk_H4&amp;index=11&amp;list=PLsRNoUx8w3rN_pD7pf1fEzVFlG3Fga9cU">TEDxUAL</a> event in 2016, the creative direction student shared his personal story. Inspired by his own journey with the virus and its stigma, Alexander launched<a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/the-positive-project-how-a-new-app-aims-to-change-our-attitude-towards-hiv-a3267321.html"> The Positive Project</a>, an app geared to build awareness around the causes and symptoms of HIV. Its users are given HIV facts, health information and directed to local treatment centres, while also building a global community of mutual support.</p>
<p>Though prevention is obviously better than cure, if one is exposed to HIV there is PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis). It is an emergency measure which combines powerful drugs to combat the virus once it is in the body, and must be taken with the first 72 hours after infection. PEP is not a ‘morning after pill’ for HIV – it is a last resort, with unpleasant side effects.</p>
<p><strong>Obstacles to overcome</strong></p>
<p>While the fear of the 80s epidemic has subsided, the stigma surrounding the virus remains strong. In May 2016, Austrian-based magazine <em>Vangardist</em> printed a special edition of its magazine using ink infused with HIV+ blood, with the hopes of raising discussion about the virus and reducing the discrimination. Apps such as Alexander’ s work to reduce stigma as well as do initiatives from organisations such as National AIDS Trust and Terrence Higgins Trust. <a href="http://www.tht.org.uk/our-charity/Our-work/What-we-do/National-HIV-testing-week">National HIV Testing Week</a> is an annual campaign which encourages people to get tested. It is free and gives an instant diagnosis. In July 2016, Prince Harry publicly took an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuGKDLycQT0">HIV test</a>.  “Whether you’re a man, woman, gay, straight, black, white, whatever – even gingers! – why wouldn’t you come and have a test?” said the royal.</p>
<p>Although we have access to the internet, where we can find out as much as possible about any subject, it still relies on a person actively seeking out the information. To be informed about something like HIV, you have to search. Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988 prohibited local authorities, such as schools and councils, from promoting or educating about homosexual lifestyle. Though it was repealed in 2000, sex education in schools remains primarily on heterosexual relationships, ignoring LGBT education. This includes issues such as HIV.</p>
<p>While van Tulleken agrees that education is vital when it comes to HIV, he also appreciates that sexual behaviours are more emotionally charged than intellectually grounded and that is something which must be worked on. “Intellectual knowledge is of less use in decision making about sexual health than more experiential and emotional knowledge. The academic knowledge that it will be more difficult living with HIV than not feels less tangible when at the decision-making moment when possibly drunk and probably horny.”</p>
<p>When it comes to HIV – or any other sexually transmitted infection – van Tulleken suggests that the best view to take is that “anyone with a sex life is at risk. When you have sex, you inherit the sexual history of everyone your partner has slept with too. That casts the net pretty wide and most of us are bad at having the conversation about who our exes have slept with and how.”When it comes to HIV, we live in an age where we have access to all the information we need and access to methods of prevention, and yet the rates of infection continue to rise. We enjoy sexual liberation and open social attitudes, but with that freedom comes responsibility – to others and to ourselves. Education, protection and prevention are the foundations of a future generation that can live without the fear of HIV and AIDS.</p>
<p>We’re not there yet, but if we also support each other, raise awareness and act responsibly, we’ll get there in the end.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Pigeons &amp; Peacocks 9: The Post-Internet Issue is our best magazine yet, and is also editor <a href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/tag/darcy-rive/">Darcy Rive’</a>s last. Here, he says goodbye and thanks all the contributors for making P&amp;P what it is today. </em></p>
<p><em><a href="http://estore.arts.ac.uk/browse/extra_info.asp?compid=1&amp;modid=1&amp;deptid=176&amp;catid=31&amp;prodid=1971">Pigeons &amp; Peacocks 9: The Post-Internet Issue</a> </em>is now out. This real and tangible printed magazine explores the digital and intangible realm of the internet, questioning its influence on fashion, society, relationships and culture. We discover how apps have shaped body image, how data is tracked, how visibility is saving society’s minorities and how new materials are being developed in machines and in petri dishes to push the boundaries of fashion and save our planet. And, of course, the magazine is filled with inspirational and profound images courtesy of the talents of London College of Fashion and our international readership. It is a great issue.</p>
<p>The <em>Post-Internet </em>issue is a great magazine, and it is also my last one as editor. I joined the <em>Pigeons &amp; Peacocks </em>team over three years ago, straight out of Master’s in <a href="http://www.arts.ac.uk/fashion/courses/postgraduate/ma-fashion-journalism/">Fashion Journalism</a>. I had known the magazine from my time studying at LCF, had ripped its pages out of the spine and stuck them to my wall. And then I was lucky enough to join its editorial team.</p>
<p>Throughout my time at the magazine, I have had to privilege to work with some of the most talented, inspiring and hard-working creatives. I have seen stories come to life through the lens of a photographer’s camera, capturing moments in time and holding them forever. I have witnessed stylists create characters in clothing, playing dress up and transcending inanimate garments into living personalities. I have been captivated by the words of writers whose opinions and perspectives have broadened my own. I consider it a great honour to have met and worked with these people, whose vision and skills have the power to change the industry, society and maybe even the world.</p>
<p>I’d like to take the opportunity to thank all our contributors to <em>Pigeons &amp; Peacocks </em>magazine over the last three and half years for making it what it is today. And I’d like to thank all the readers, from all over the globe, for being part of our journey. I am so excited to see the next chapter of <em>P&amp;P </em>and wish the next team and the all coming contributors the very best.</p>

<div id="attachment_15719" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href=" "><img class="size-large wp-image-15719" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/rah_34696520225-470x264.jpg" alt="Image via Sadler's Wells" width="470" height="264" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/rah_34696520225-470x264.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/rah_34696520225-310x174.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/rah_34696520225-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/rah_34696520225-300x169.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/rah_34696520225.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Image via Sadler&#8217;s Wells</p></div>
<p>“Thank you, Carlos!” shouted an anonymous audience member in the closing moment of Carlos Acosta’s <em>Classical Farewell</em> at the Royal Albert Hall. This was just ahead of a standing ovation that lasted at least fifteen minutes, if not even longer. Acosta, the Cuban dancer famous the world over as a tour-de-force of ballet, is loved by his audience and has been throughout his extensive two-decade career. Now, as the dancer retires from classical ballet, he rewards his audience one last time with a farewell tour, co-produced by Sadler’s Wells.</p>
<p>The production opens with <em>Winter Dreams</em> (Farewell Pas de Deux), performed by Acosta and Marianela Nunez. It’s a delicate, almost fragile dance, with the heartbreak of parting lovers. In <em>Mayering</em> (Final Pas de Deux), this emotion is intensified and strained with a desperate scene of doomed lovers. Throughout, you could hear a pin drop as the audience lost itself in the tragedy. Acosta returns with Nunez in <em>Don Quixote</em> (Pas de Deux), which in contrast is such a jolly and high-spirited performance, and affords both dancers to showcase their jaw-dropping talents with endless pirouettes and gravity-defying leaps, while in <em>Apollo</em> (Pas de Deux), the choreography is gentle and almost solemn.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <em>Dying Swan</em>, performed by the infallible Sarah Lamb, is the height of beauty and sadness – there is a reason it is one of the most iconic pieces of the ballet choreography. <em>Rhapsody</em> (Pas de Deux) is a fairy tale come to life, with glittering costume and such innocence in the choreography, danced by Yuhui Choe and Valentino Zucchetti. <em>Rubies</em> (Pas de Deux), performed by Lamb and Zucchetti, is charged and shows the technical accomplishment in the dancers. <em>Anadromous</em>, danced by Gabriela Lugo and Luis Valle, is truly spectacular. It reaches something otherworldly in its choreography and reflects a story of survival against adversity.</p>
<p>Though Acosta is retiring from classical ballet, he will continue to perform contemporary dance and direct his dance company Acosta Danza. Audiences can look forward to seeing more of the dancer in the future, but looking back on his career, they can thank him for all he has brought to the stage, to his craft and the world of ballet. Thank you, Acosta.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>P&amp;P <em>sits down with writer Jack Mills, Deputy Editor of </em><a href="http://www.wonderlandmagazine.com/">Wonderland</a> <em>magazine, to talk about rat-infested beginnings, pushing the creative boundaries and boozing with Mariah Carey. </em></p>
<div id="attachment_15629" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-15629" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/FullSizeRender-470x619.jpg" alt="Image courtesy of Jack Mills" width="470" height="619" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/FullSizeRender-470x619.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/FullSizeRender-310x408.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/FullSizeRender-300x395.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/FullSizeRender.jpg 759w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Image courtesy of Jack Mills</p></div>
<p><em>How and why did you get into the world of publication?</em></p>
<p>I certainly didn’t get in it to make money. My parents are both journalists, so I knew the deal from a young age. Journalism is about non-fiction storytelling – finding the story in a story. You find an interesting subject, hang out with them and discover the hook. It’s kind of like urban anthropology. I also like picking up on new youth culture crazes and movements before anyone else has had the chance to, things like Soundcloud communities, sub and counter-culture collectives and nightlife movements.</p>
<p><em>What is your approach to writing? </em></p>
<p>I almost always get anxiety before writing, because my process tends to be quite full on and draining. I put a lot into pieces and spend time working up to a lede or angle and researching the weirdest facts about subjects. As such, it can take days to sit down with something, and even when I’m into it, I’ll take massive breaks so as to keep the creative momentum going. I never tend to just “settle” into a piece, thinking about it over the course of three or four days to keep it invigorating &#8211; not to sound like a tortured dickhead…</p>
<p><em>What attracted you to working for a fashion publication?</em></p>
<p>I see <em>Wonderland </em>and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rollacoastermagazine/?hl=en"><em>Rollacoaster</em></a> more as trend publications than style magazines. With London trend magazines, there’s invariably a wider story or metaphor at hand when the focus is on young designers. They want to shout about something they’re obsessed with – like a grass roots issue or aesthetics – rather than tailoring details.</p>
<div id="attachment_15630" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-15630" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/WONDERLAND_MARIAH-e1398792147871-470x613.jpg" alt="Mariah Carey for Wonderland Magazine" width="470" height="613" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/WONDERLAND_MARIAH-e1398792147871-470x613.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/WONDERLAND_MARIAH-e1398792147871-310x404.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/WONDERLAND_MARIAH-e1398792147871-300x391.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/WONDERLAND_MARIAH-e1398792147871.jpg 520w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mariah Carey for Wonderland Magazine</p></div>
<p><em>What does being an editor of a magazine entail?</em></p>
<p>Having a point of difference: what can you, specifically you, bring to the table? Are you hilarious? Do you know more about emerging fashion or music labels than your peers? Capitalise on it: make a whole issue about labels or something. The ‘label issue’ could spotlight emerging music subgenres, the evolution of vintage clothing logos, new fashion collectives, gender labels and so on. Think about how this could sit with the issues’ graphic design cues too: maybe story titles could double as peal-away labels that readers could stick around their rooms. Themes are really important, but putting a personal stamp on your magazine is paramount.</p>
<p><em>Explain a bit more about Wonderland?</em></p>
<p>Wonderland is a youth culture and fashion quarterly. We cover pop culture in a more light-hearted, less po-faced way than some of our indie competitors. The Lana Del Rey shoot in 2011 was a perfect example of this — even though it was her first ever cover shoot, we played on her slightly concussed, pop-noirish appeal in an intentionally funny, colourful, fluffy way. <a href="http://www.wonderlandmagazine.com/2013/04/flashback-friday-lana-del-rey/">The interview was smart and sardonic too – a great read by Hanna Hanra</a>.</p>
<p><em>What do you enjoy the most about your job at </em>Wonderland<em> magazine?</em></p>
<p>Probably coming up with original features ideas, discovering new talent and putting weird spins on the classic interview profile format. It’s important to never take the same approach to a feature twice, so you&#8217;re constantly thinking up fresh ways to grab peoples’ attention. In the last issue of <em>Rollacoaster,</em> I got a writer to map out a fictional, Homer&#8217;s Odyssey-esque account of how he met members of a music collective through the night across south London – the quotes were real, though. Also, we asked a graduate illustrator to interpret what the clothing lines of cults led by a group of influential London designers would look like.</p>

<p><em>Who has been your favourite notable person you have interviewed?</em></p>
<p>Willem Dafoe was great, I interviewed him with the producers of a sci-fi film called <em>John Carter</em> before it came out. The movie turned out to be one of Hollywood’s biggest ever financial flops. I remember him saying he only ever does these big budget films to fund the experimental theatre company he runs in New York (The Wooster Group). Obviously getting mad-drunk with Mariah Carey in her hotel room for the cover of <em>Wonderland</em> was insane, as was chatting to Isabella Rossellini about her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WtftQ7AbEw">Green Porno YouTube</a> series from the London Bulgari office — with everyone listening in. I enjoyed a long, hungover morning at The (posh) Delaunay with Gwendoline Christie and Gareth Pugh, who thought I was a stray when I first walked in. Gwendoline spent the entire time swinging her sword arm over our heads a la Brienne of Tarth, her <em>Game of Thrones</em> character.</p>
<p><em>What advice would you give someone who is starting out in their career and wants to work at a magazine?</em></p>
<p>If you have a knack for hooking onto youth culture movements or trends before they snowball and have a handle on your writing style, it’s important to remain pretty resilient. Even if you’re broke, try not to worry about money at the start – work in a bar and craft your trade on the side. When I started out, I was the Deputy Editor of a start-up London culture magazine, working from a hollowed out Dickensian ex-pub in Kentish Town. I supported this by working as a cash-in-hand barman at a weekly poker night and at the pub I lived next to in Tooting, south London. When you’ve got rats running around your feet and are perched under a roof that’s bowing under the weight of snowfall, you can’t help but think, “Is this actually what I’m pushing to do?”</p>
<p><em>What do you look for in an intern?</em></p>
<p>Someone with a point of difference (which you very rarely find). When I interned, I was the one who was into extreme music, outlandish art, anything visceral and challenging. It’s important to scuff your path at a magazine without annoying anyone too much. The worst thing you can do is pitch compliantly &#8211; talents the magazine has already covered, have already had generous coverage in competitive titles or talents that fold neatly into the background. Find the angle first, then pitch.</p>

<p><em>Do you go to any talks or lectures to help students? </em></p>
<p>I’m currently working with a fashion branding, styling and photography course that Nick Knight heads up, giving students feedback on their project DNA, press strategies and how to write about your work clearly and divisively. I might explore teaching at some point, maybe a journalism course!</p>
<p><em>Other than internships, how else can students get their work out there when they graduate? </em></p>
<p>It’s not just about pitching ideas to your favourite magazines, although that’s definitely a good start. You’ve actually got to be a bit more cunning now every other person under 25 is a journalist. What areas do you want to focus on that no-one else does? Focus on developing a distinctive writing style too — are you a sarcastic writer? Funny, experimental, meta, dark?</p>
<p><em>What’s your approach to networking and collaborations?</em></p>
<p>It’s always good to talk to people, but don’t force anything. If you happen to be at the same drinks event as one of your idols, it’s probably a good idea to introduce yourself. But if the conversation doesn’t go anywhere, you probably weren’t meant to collaborate. Focus on the organic creative relationships you’ve had with someone and call them up again. If you find you can fluidly spark ideas of each other and come up with something worthwhile, you should hold onto that. Having said that, it’s good to reach out to people you want to work with over email. Cold calling is to be avoided at all costs.</p>

<p><em>Do you prefer digital or print?</em></p>
<p>I like them both for different reasons. Print will survive, but these titles won&#8217;t be where you go to find a job in journalism. All the existing main independent, commercially-owned and newsprint publications will go fully digital in the next ten years, I think. It&#8217;s pretty exciting, because the whole game is being rewritten, there&#8217;s not even time to plan it. It&#8217;s democratising all of our news media.</p>
<p><em>What has influenced your writing style?</em></p>
<p>Haruki Murikami’s stories unfold in 24-hour periods and I’ve essentially applied that to my interview style. I’m interested in approaching non-fiction storytelling using fiction writing forms. I interviewed Agyness Deyn in the back of a cab and she picked out spots we drove past on the way to her hotel, like the street the club Punk used to be on. She started reminiscing. The article ended up being about the journey, pretty much minute by minute. Elsewhere I’m into boozy writers like Patrick Hamilton and long-form New Yorker-style journalists like Sam Knight. Fiona Duncan is a great music writer too.</p>
<p><em>What lessons have learnt along the way?</em></p>
<p>Never have an argument with someone over email; never give up on a good idea and remind yourself that when it comes to putting a magazine together, artistic integrity is more important than money.</p>
<p><em>If you were not the Deputy Editor of Wonderland, what would you be doing?</em></p>
<p>Filmmaking. I&#8217;d love to make a film like<em> Naked</em> or <em>The Crying Game</em>: gritty, slightly hypnotic films that ultimately speak to you on a very human level. I think those kinds of movies are all about urban escapism, the things a big city has to offer people with a mad curiosity for life. It’s all pretty subliminal.</p>
