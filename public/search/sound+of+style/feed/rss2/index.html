				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hanna Puskarz, photographer and one half of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/handzaround/">@HandZaround</a> interviewed <a href="https://www.lalaloveworld.com">Lalalove</a> founder and designer, Linda Choroenlab during her world travels.</p>

<p><strong><em>How did Lalalove start? We read on you blog that it all started in London, </em><em>at the Portobello Road Market.</em></strong></p>
<p>Do you wanna have the real real story, or made up story to make it sound good?</p>
<p><strong><em>The real one!</em></strong></p>
<p>There are two stories &#8211; one is the good one and one is the real one. The real one starts from [the moment of my] study at LCF. I was studying styling and photography and actually, I really wanted to be a stylist. At the time I worked in a Thai restaurant. Like everyone in London, you needed to work part-time to pay the rent… or to do whatever.</p>
<p>When I worked in a Thai restaurant, it wasn’t related to what I wanted to do at all, and it wasn’t really bringing me anything. I managed to get a job at Gucci during the period I was studying styling and photography. After that, when I graduated, I worked in Moschino in visual merchandise. I didn’t want to do that, however it was related to my subject, but I thought it was better than doing anything else. I still wanted to be a stylist, so I did lots of test shoots and I worked as an intern at Dazed and Confused. But it was all for free, you didn’t get paid. I did lookbooks for Maria Francesca Pepe, Gareth Pugh…but we never got paid…</p>
<p><strong><em>Such big people and they don&#8217;t have money…</em></strong></p>
<p>Really big people and they don&#8217;t get that I need to work in the shop to earn something. I was like ‘Hey, what I earn is not enough, after I pay the rent, I struggle a lot!’ So I was thinking what can I do to have more time, to do styling, to earn money… I am not a designer, but I thought I could maybe design a t-shirt. I sent a file to Bangkok, so they could do a silk screen print for me on a tshirt, and they sent it back here, to London. That was the beginning of my career as a designer. I didn’t really consider myself a designer, because I felt I was a stylist, but I thought I could do it as a hobby.  I tried to get a store in Portobello Market, but it was really difficult to get one because they have a system there, similar to one in the mafia… You need to pay cash to the people; you need to wait in the queue. I pretended to be a really innocent Thai girl…and I got the stall! I started to sell there regularly, but it was so tough! I didn’t sell the t-shirts for cheap. I designed the prints myself so I charged about £20 for a t-shirt. After some time, I also opened a stall in the Spitalfields Market. I worked every Saturday and Sunday and it was really hard. People of the new generation don&#8217;t understand how hard it is… They think everything so easy. You don&#8217;t have any money, you have two big suitcases you have to get on the bus, then wait in the queue for your stall, and you might get the stall on the day or not…you don&#8217;t even know. It just turns out at the spot. You just have to wait for the decision because you are new.</p>
<p><strong><em>So how did it all evolve into more than selling at the stall?</em></strong></p>
<p>After some time I had Japanese buyers come to buy in Portobello in wholesale. I didn’t even know what wholesale was. It was a learning process. After a year, a distributor from Italy came across my stall. They wanted to resell my t-shirts. I didn’t know much about it but I was lucky &#8211; I was able to turn to my friends. In the end, my t-shirts were selling at a department store in Italy for about €80 each! So I quit Moschino because I had enough money to do styling for free.</p>
<p><strong><em>So how did that all work out after you quit Moschino?</em></strong></p>
<p>It was good! I did a lot of styling and eventually I got an offer to be a fashion editor for Wallpaper Magazine, Thai edition. I did that also for Dazed &amp; Confused Japan, everything was going okay.</p>
<p>Then I had a baby, Lulu. After I gave birth, it was difficult because I didn’t have my family to be with me all the time. My husband’s family came to see us<br />
once or twice a week but it was different to the Thai culture &#8211; Asian family helps you a lot with taking care of the baby. I couldn’t do styling because I had to take care of Lulu, so my family suggested moving back to Thailand for a while. My family really supports my career and so I decided to move back for a while. It meant I could do collections and hire people to help me so I can also do styling. In the meantime my family helps me with taking care of Lulu whilst my husband, Mark, who is a musician, goes back and forth every 6 weeks between England and Bangkok.</p>
<p><strong><em>So how did it all move on since you returned to Bangkok?</em></strong></p>
<p>At the beginning it was just ok. But then lots of things started to happen &#8211; working as a stylist, billboards for departments stores, magazines. Then Topshop noticed <em>Lalalove</em> and we were selling in Topshop in London’s Oxford Street for three years. We don’t do it anymore though. It’s too much going on here! I now have a <em>Lalalove</em> store in Siam Paragon Shopping Centre.</p>
<p><strong><em>So that’s how Lalalove was born! Did you have to change your audience </em><em>when you moved to Bangkok? In the UK the fashions are different than </em><em>here.</em></strong></p>
<p>Actually, I never compromise with my style at all. In Siam Center, mainly tourists buy my things, Chinese or European. But actually I don&#8217;t care. If Thai people don&#8217;t buy it, I don&#8217;t give a damn, I&#8217;m not going to pretend to sell lace or pastels. I would get so bored.</p>
<p><em style="font-weight: bold">You don&#8217;t need to compromise! It seems like there is a whole new audience for you now!</em> <strong><em>What are you inspirations? Lalalove looks so colourful, and full of life.</em></strong></p>
<p>I really love positive things. Actually I love nature and I love animals. I love flowers. I Really want to be positive and colourful because at the moment the world is stressful enough. I don’t want to be bothered with all that shit! I want to be nice and colourful, and make people smile. This is my brand.</p>
<p><em style="font-weight: bold">Can you tell us about the Pa Kao Ma Collection? I love that it is inspired </em><em style="font-weight: bold">by the Thai culture. You use original Thai fabrics produced in rural areas.</em> <strong><em>Can you tell us some more about that?</em></strong></p>
<p>Yes! The government contacted me. They do collaborations with high fashion Thai brands, but usually with the very traditional ones. And they asked me to collaborate with them, I don&#8217;t know what on earth they were thinking!</p>
<p><strong><em>But you agreed, and it all worked out! What was it all about?</em></strong></p>
<p>Deep in my heart I really like nature, so I want to be sustainable. But this project was supposed to be just for the fashion show. In Thailand we have artists and designers, who collaborate just for the fashion shows and then the projects are over. I really disagree with it, because it&#8217;s such a waste of time. When I got the collaboration offer, I started to research why Thai people don’t buy traditional Thai silk anymore. Why does the new generation not wear it? What’s the problem?<br />
The government pays the designers money to do the fashion show and then it’s all in press and that’s it. And then what, they promise to the village to buy Thai silk, they give them money once but do they ever buy more? Do they buy every month? The villagers really hope to improve their situation and if they get paid only once it doesn’t really keep the Thai economy growing.</p>
<p>I expressed my opinion and tried to talk to them, but because it’s their idea I couldn’t say much to change it. We were almost finished with the collection for the fashion show and then the next day the King passed away…I then got a call from the government that the project will be cancelled. I told them ‘why cancel’? They already spent a lot of money and I made the collection.<br />
They said we can’t go on with the fashion show because the King passed away. I tried to prove them that this is not what the King would want. He wouldn’t want them to spend all this money for nothing. I suggested spending the rest of the money not on the fashion show but on doing a look book, PR and spreading the word, because we worked very hard on making this combination of sustainable Thai fabric and quirky street wear… We went to the village by ourselves to talk to the people, who make the fabric, who yarn. They only do it part-time because it doesn’t bring them enough money. So they work as farmers the rest of the time. However, if we ordered every month or two, this could become their full-time career. So I said to the government ‘If you want to cancel, I will still charge you 100%.’</p>
<p><strong><em>Did the fashion week happen?</em></strong></p>
<p>No, the fashion week didn’t happen but it’s actually good because I could use the money to do a really nice look book and towards the trade show abroad, not just in Thailand. We’re going to Japan for Tokyo Fashion Week.<br />
I think the more Thai people can see our collection showcased abroad, the more they will consider it cool and will go back to support it. If we got Pa Kao Ma to sell in a store abroad, people in Thailand would want to wear it themselves. They would be inspired by the fashion abroad &#8211; Paris, London, Berlin, wherever. So getting Pa Kao Ma there would help the young Thai generation to see that this is not fucked up, this is cool and you can wear it!<br />
I am not religious and I don’t go to temples, but this is what I can do for my country. I love my country and this is what I can do, being myself.</p>
<p><strong><em>Change the world in your own way!</em></strong></p>
<p>Exactly, in my own way. There are 1000 villages in Thailand, I am the only brand, who started to work with them. I cannot use fabrics from all the 1000 villages but if you’re a new designer, don’t fly to Paris to see ‘the best world’. Go to Chiang Rai first. See what they have. Economy will grow! Thai people need to be together to help each other. Not just think ‘Paris is fucking cool’. No!</p>
<p><strong><em>What do you consider to be your biggest achievement?</em></strong></p>
<p>My biggest achievement is happiness. I don&#8217;t need lots of money. The happiness comes from people wearing my clothes and using them to express themselves. And another thing is having more time with my daughter.</p>
<p><strong><em>So when you see someone walking on the street wearing your clothes,</em> <em>what do you do?</em></strong></p>
<p>I run and hug them, and say: ‘Thank you, thank you! OMG thank you! Can I take a picture with you!’. I am so over the moon. I think I will be like this forever.</p>
<p><strong><em>What has been the biggest difficulty on your journey?</em></strong></p>
<p>Dealing with people! Always people!</p>
<p><strong><em>How do you deal with the people who are on different wavelength than</em> <em>you in the fashion world?</em></strong></p>
<p>I try to close my eyes. If the money is not good to deal with, I don’t deal with it. No time for drama. It&#8217;s good though, because in my industry I have my good friends. We see a lot people, who are really selfish in fashion, and in other fields. They&#8217;ve got to survive, but don&#8217;t do too much. Everyone wants to be rich and take advantage so much. But you need to be a role model!</p>
<p><strong><em>What about sustainability? Last time we met, you said you’re working on </em><em>your collection to be sustainable. Were you always sustainable?</em></strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;re sustainable in like 70%, which is good as this is the first collection. I did my best, but I think we’ll improve with every collection. A couple percent more with each one. In my factory, I check myself what they do. It&#8217;s not sweat &amp; tears. That&#8217;s why the price is not cheap. It&#8217;s not unreachable though. If someone asks me why [something from Lalalove] is not 100 baht…the fabric is 400 baht, plus shipping to Bangkok, plus my work, plus pay for people sewing, plus I need to pay VAT. I can&#8217;t say that though…so, I just smile. I say that to myself. On the outside I am smiling, but I&#8217;m thinking &#8216;Just fuck off&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong><em>We found the older generation of Thais to be very traditional and </em><em>conservative so when we first saw your stuff, we thought ‘Wow, that&#8217;s </em><em>different!’ Where do you think the fashion industry in Thailand is at?</em></strong></p>
<p>I think Thailand can do very well. I think that Thailand is actually the best of South East Asia already. But the price point is&#8230; We are in the middle, which is such a shame. We are between H&amp;M &amp; Zara and Gucci &amp; Louis Vuitton.<br />
People see us because we are doing so much hard work, and they do think it’s good, yet they choose to buy H&amp;M. Or they choose to buy Zara. Let’s say in Zara the dress is about 3000 baht, the dress from a Thai designer is 8000 baht. But, if they are to spend 8000, they prefer to buy something from Paris, which is 16,000 baht. They appreciate the name, or the tag &#8216;made in Paris&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong><em>What has made you successful? What makes a good designer? Why do </em><em>you think you are at the point you are at now?</em></strong></p>
<p>I think because I have my positive attitude and I don’t give up. I keep going and try to find my happiness. I&#8217;m not going to do something that makes me unhappy, because I don’t just want a number in the bank. I can go on a cheap holiday! I don&#8217;t need to be in luxury all the time…just sometimes I need it, haha!</p>
<p><strong><em>How do you imagine LaLaLove’s future?</em></strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t need to be a too big of a company. I want to know everyone and be close to everyone in my brand. And talk, and drink and have dinner with everyone, who works with me. I want everyone to be happy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Listen to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/parcelsmusic/">Parcels</a> and be transported back to the 70s. With their synths, funk influence and nostalgic melodies, Parcels are bringing disco back and we are loving it.</em></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-15749" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/thumbnail_PARCELS_01sqrwebByCai_Leplaw-Lowres-470x515.jpg" alt="thumbnail_PARCELS_01sqrwebByCai_Leplaw Lowres" width="470" height="515" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/thumbnail_PARCELS_01sqrwebByCai_Leplaw-Lowres-470x515.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/thumbnail_PARCELS_01sqrwebByCai_Leplaw-Lowres-310x340.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/thumbnail_PARCELS_01sqrwebByCai_Leplaw-Lowres-768x841.jpg 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/thumbnail_PARCELS_01sqrwebByCai_Leplaw-Lowres-300x329.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/thumbnail_PARCELS_01sqrwebByCai_Leplaw-Lowres.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>
<p><em>How did the band come together?</em></p>
<p>For years in Australia we all knew one another. We had played in a bunch of bands together since we were 13 or so. It naturally fell into this formation when we discovered The Funk, electronic music and production.</p>
<p><em>How would you describe your sound?</em></p>
<p>It’s a disco dance party on acid. Sometimes the trip makes you want to question yourself and everything else; sometimes you just want to get down.</p>
<p><em>Tell us about your new single</em> MyEnemy.</p>
<p>That groove came from Jules’s bedroom back in Australia! Nearly 2 years ago, he sent us the basis after a fuzzy all-nighter involving strippers, cocaine and motorbikes. It all came together in Berlin where we worked it into shape, wrote the vocal fronting and rerecorded it together.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7KSn-vAH3nA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><em>There is something so nostalgic and dreamy about your music – is that an important element of your work?</em></p>
<p>Yeah. The nostalgia comes from our influences and the classic feel. The dreaminess I guess stems from the self-production and electronic elements. Also our lyrics are never very clear – they make their point quite indirectly, dreamily.</p>
<p><em>How, as a band, did you arrive at this signature style?</em></p>
<p>We came from a wild array of backgrounds which gave us individual ideals. We then came together with a joint love for classic disco, funk, pop and nu electronic production and Parcels came out. But we&#8217;re ever-changing and still finding our pocket.</p>
<p><em>Who are your musical influences?</em></p>
<p>Chic, Bowie, Kraftwerk, Tribe, Dylan, Megadeth, Gorillaz, Chopin, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Beach Boys and Katy Perry.</p>
<p><em>You’re based in Berlin at the moment – has this affected your approach to music in any way?</em></p>
<p>Certainly. The electronic and techno scene inevitably hit us and we took on the driving feel immediately. We discovered Kraftwerk in all their subtle electro glory. And in winter, it’s too cold to leave the god damn flat, so we&#8217;re writing like crazy.</p>
<p><em>Berlin is such an amazing city – has it challenged or developed you creatively in any way?</em></p>
<p>It’s a super sweet city! We have at times also felt like it lacks the disco (in a live setting). But we&#8217;re gathering troops and launching an all out groove attack, starting with our secret dance parties.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-qHOAuQaBMA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><em>What do you think of the London music scene?</em></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve played two shows in London. Both were club shows with dark dance vibe. The crowds have been eager thus far – can’t wait to bring party there again! (<em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/949548008507398/">Parcels play Hoxton Square Bar and Kitchen 07/10/16!</a>)</em></p>
<p><em>You’re from Australia – how do European venues differ from Australian venues?</em></p>
<p>A venue is a venue is a venue. It’s all in the crowd! Two crowds are never the same – that’s what makes it exciting, trying to create and cultivate an energy in a new situation.  So far, Europeans have been super attentive and ready to party.</p>
<p><em>What’s your favourite thing about playing live?</em></p>
<p>Its the only 45 minutes of our lives in which we actually know what we&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p><em>What’s been your most memorable live performance so far and why?</em></p>
<p>A couple of weeks back, we threw a secret Berlin party. It was low-key, down a back alley in a little room with a couple of other bands and 100 of our friends getting absolutely sweaty on the disco floor. Lately every gig has been super exciting though!</p>

<p><em>Are you working on an album?</em></p>
<p>We&#8217;re not prepared to talk album yet, but we have an EP on the way! Jan2017.</p>
<p><em>I love the 70s/slightly kitsch style of the band and it’s music – do you ever feel like you were born into the wrong generation?</em></p>
<p>Not really – we definitely idolise music of the past and recording in the 70s and 80s. But we also love what’s going on now in many ways, that’s where we find our blend and we wouldn’t rather be anywhere else!</p>
<p><em>What else we can we expect to see from you in the near future? </em></p>
<p>Better song writing, smoother production, a bolder live show, more visual exploration. We are so excited for loads of shows and more recording in 2017!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>P&amp;P <em>sits down with writer Jack Mills, Deputy Editor of </em><a href="http://www.wonderlandmagazine.com/">Wonderland</a> <em>magazine, to talk about rat-infested beginnings, pushing the creative boundaries and boozing with Mariah Carey. </em></p>
<div id="attachment_15629" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-15629" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/FullSizeRender-470x619.jpg" alt="Image courtesy of Jack Mills" width="470" height="619" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/FullSizeRender-470x619.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/FullSizeRender-310x408.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/FullSizeRender-300x395.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/FullSizeRender.jpg 759w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Image courtesy of Jack Mills</p></div>
<p><em>How and why did you get into the world of publication?</em></p>
<p>I certainly didn’t get in it to make money. My parents are both journalists, so I knew the deal from a young age. Journalism is about non-fiction storytelling – finding the story in a story. You find an interesting subject, hang out with them and discover the hook. It’s kind of like urban anthropology. I also like picking up on new youth culture crazes and movements before anyone else has had the chance to, things like Soundcloud communities, sub and counter-culture collectives and nightlife movements.</p>
<p><em>What is your approach to writing? </em></p>
<p>I almost always get anxiety before writing, because my process tends to be quite full on and draining. I put a lot into pieces and spend time working up to a lede or angle and researching the weirdest facts about subjects. As such, it can take days to sit down with something, and even when I’m into it, I’ll take massive breaks so as to keep the creative momentum going. I never tend to just “settle” into a piece, thinking about it over the course of three or four days to keep it invigorating &#8211; not to sound like a tortured dickhead…</p>
<p><em>What attracted you to working for a fashion publication?</em></p>
<p>I see <em>Wonderland </em>and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rollacoastermagazine/?hl=en"><em>Rollacoaster</em></a> more as trend publications than style magazines. With London trend magazines, there’s invariably a wider story or metaphor at hand when the focus is on young designers. They want to shout about something they’re obsessed with – like a grass roots issue or aesthetics – rather than tailoring details.</p>
<div id="attachment_15630" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-15630" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/WONDERLAND_MARIAH-e1398792147871-470x613.jpg" alt="Mariah Carey for Wonderland Magazine" width="470" height="613" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/WONDERLAND_MARIAH-e1398792147871-470x613.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/WONDERLAND_MARIAH-e1398792147871-310x404.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/WONDERLAND_MARIAH-e1398792147871-300x391.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/WONDERLAND_MARIAH-e1398792147871.jpg 520w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mariah Carey for Wonderland Magazine</p></div>
<p><em>What does being an editor of a magazine entail?</em></p>
<p>Having a point of difference: what can you, specifically you, bring to the table? Are you hilarious? Do you know more about emerging fashion or music labels than your peers? Capitalise on it: make a whole issue about labels or something. The ‘label issue’ could spotlight emerging music subgenres, the evolution of vintage clothing logos, new fashion collectives, gender labels and so on. Think about how this could sit with the issues’ graphic design cues too: maybe story titles could double as peal-away labels that readers could stick around their rooms. Themes are really important, but putting a personal stamp on your magazine is paramount.</p>
<p><em>Explain a bit more about Wonderland?</em></p>
<p>Wonderland is a youth culture and fashion quarterly. We cover pop culture in a more light-hearted, less po-faced way than some of our indie competitors. The Lana Del Rey shoot in 2011 was a perfect example of this — even though it was her first ever cover shoot, we played on her slightly concussed, pop-noirish appeal in an intentionally funny, colourful, fluffy way. <a href="http://www.wonderlandmagazine.com/2013/04/flashback-friday-lana-del-rey/">The interview was smart and sardonic too – a great read by Hanna Hanra</a>.</p>
<p><em>What do you enjoy the most about your job at </em>Wonderland<em> magazine?</em></p>
<p>Probably coming up with original features ideas, discovering new talent and putting weird spins on the classic interview profile format. It’s important to never take the same approach to a feature twice, so you&#8217;re constantly thinking up fresh ways to grab peoples’ attention. In the last issue of <em>Rollacoaster,</em> I got a writer to map out a fictional, Homer&#8217;s Odyssey-esque account of how he met members of a music collective through the night across south London – the quotes were real, though. Also, we asked a graduate illustrator to interpret what the clothing lines of cults led by a group of influential London designers would look like.</p>
<div id="attachment_15631" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-15631" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/tumblr_n57zkuZ9rf1qa42jro1_1280-470x350.jpg" alt="Mariah Carey for Wonderland Magazine" width="470" height="350" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/tumblr_n57zkuZ9rf1qa42jro1_1280-470x350.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/tumblr_n57zkuZ9rf1qa42jro1_1280-310x231.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/tumblr_n57zkuZ9rf1qa42jro1_1280-768x572.jpg 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/tumblr_n57zkuZ9rf1qa42jro1_1280-300x223.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/tumblr_n57zkuZ9rf1qa42jro1_1280.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mariah Carey for Wonderland Magazine</p></div>
<p><em>Who has been your favourite notable person you have interviewed?</em></p>
<p>Willem Dafoe was great, I interviewed him with the producers of a sci-fi film called <em>John Carter</em> before it came out. The movie turned out to be one of Hollywood’s biggest ever financial flops. I remember him saying he only ever does these big budget films to fund the experimental theatre company he runs in New York (The Wooster Group). Obviously getting mad-drunk with Mariah Carey in her hotel room for the cover of <em>Wonderland</em> was insane, as was chatting to Isabella Rossellini about her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WtftQ7AbEw">Green Porno YouTube</a> series from the London Bulgari office — with everyone listening in. I enjoyed a long, hungover morning at The (posh) Delaunay with Gwendoline Christie and Gareth Pugh, who thought I was a stray when I first walked in. Gwendoline spent the entire time swinging her sword arm over our heads a la Brienne of Tarth, her <em>Game of Thrones</em> character.</p>
<p><em>What advice would you give someone who is starting out in their career and wants to work at a magazine?</em></p>
<p>If you have a knack for hooking onto youth culture movements or trends before they snowball and have a handle on your writing style, it’s important to remain pretty resilient. Even if you’re broke, try not to worry about money at the start – work in a bar and craft your trade on the side. When I started out, I was the Deputy Editor of a start-up London culture magazine, working from a hollowed out Dickensian ex-pub in Kentish Town. I supported this by working as a cash-in-hand barman at a weekly poker night and at the pub I lived next to in Tooting, south London. When you’ve got rats running around your feet and are perched under a roof that’s bowing under the weight of snowfall, you can’t help but think, “Is this actually what I’m pushing to do?”</p>
<p><em>What do you look for in an intern?</em></p>
<p>Someone with a point of difference (which you very rarely find). When I interned, I was the one who was into extreme music, outlandish art, anything visceral and challenging. It’s important to scuff your path at a magazine without annoying anyone too much. The worst thing you can do is pitch compliantly &#8211; talents the magazine has already covered, have already had generous coverage in competitive titles or talents that fold neatly into the background. Find the angle first, then pitch.</p>
<div id="attachment_15632" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-15632" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Lana-Del-Rey-In-Denim-Shorts-For-Wonderland-Magazine-ph-AJ-Numan-470x608.jpg" alt="Lana Del Rey for Wonderland Magazine" width="470" height="608" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Lana-Del-Rey-In-Denim-Shorts-For-Wonderland-Magazine-ph-AJ-Numan-470x608.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Lana-Del-Rey-In-Denim-Shorts-For-Wonderland-Magazine-ph-AJ-Numan-310x401.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Lana-Del-Rey-In-Denim-Shorts-For-Wonderland-Magazine-ph-AJ-Numan-768x994.jpg 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Lana-Del-Rey-In-Denim-Shorts-For-Wonderland-Magazine-ph-AJ-Numan-300x388.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Lana-Del-Rey-In-Denim-Shorts-For-Wonderland-Magazine-ph-AJ-Numan.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Lana Del Rey for Wonderland Magazine</p></div>
<p><em>Do you go to any talks or lectures to help students? </em></p>
<p>I’m currently working with a fashion branding, styling and photography course that Nick Knight heads up, giving students feedback on their project DNA, press strategies and how to write about your work clearly and divisively. I might explore teaching at some point, maybe a journalism course!</p>
<p><em>Other than internships, how else can students get their work out there when they graduate? </em></p>
<p>It’s not just about pitching ideas to your favourite magazines, although that’s definitely a good start. You’ve actually got to be a bit more cunning now every other person under 25 is a journalist. What areas do you want to focus on that no-one else does? Focus on developing a distinctive writing style too — are you a sarcastic writer? Funny, experimental, meta, dark?</p>
<p><em>What’s your approach to networking and collaborations?</em></p>
<p>It’s always good to talk to people, but don’t force anything. If you happen to be at the same drinks event as one of your idols, it’s probably a good idea to introduce yourself. But if the conversation doesn’t go anywhere, you probably weren’t meant to collaborate. Focus on the organic creative relationships you’ve had with someone and call them up again. If you find you can fluidly spark ideas of each other and come up with something worthwhile, you should hold onto that. Having said that, it’s good to reach out to people you want to work with over email. Cold calling is to be avoided at all costs.</p>
<div id="attachment_15633" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-15633" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/81463-800w-470x656.jpg" alt="Lana Del Rey for Wonderland Magazine" width="470" height="656" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/81463-800w-470x656.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/81463-800w-310x432.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/81463-800w-768x1071.jpg 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/81463-800w-300x419.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/81463-800w.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Lana Del Rey for Wonderland Magazine</p></div>
<p><em>Do you prefer digital or print?</em></p>
<p>I like them both for different reasons. Print will survive, but these titles won&#8217;t be where you go to find a job in journalism. All the existing main independent, commercially-owned and newsprint publications will go fully digital in the next ten years, I think. It&#8217;s pretty exciting, because the whole game is being rewritten, there&#8217;s not even time to plan it. It&#8217;s democratising all of our news media.</p>
<p><em>What has influenced your writing style?</em></p>
<p>Haruki Murikami’s stories unfold in 24-hour periods and I’ve essentially applied that to my interview style. I’m interested in approaching non-fiction storytelling using fiction writing forms. I interviewed Agyness Deyn in the back of a cab and she picked out spots we drove past on the way to her hotel, like the street the club Punk used to be on. She started reminiscing. The article ended up being about the journey, pretty much minute by minute. Elsewhere I’m into boozy writers like Patrick Hamilton and long-form New Yorker-style journalists like Sam Knight. Fiona Duncan is a great music writer too.</p>
<p><em>What lessons have learnt along the way?</em></p>
<p>Never have an argument with someone over email; never give up on a good idea and remind yourself that when it comes to putting a magazine together, artistic integrity is more important than money.</p>
<p><em>If you were not the Deputy Editor of Wonderland, what would you be doing?</em></p>
<p>Filmmaking. I&#8217;d love to make a film like<em> Naked</em> or <em>The Crying Game</em>: gritty, slightly hypnotic films that ultimately speak to you on a very human level. I think those kinds of movies are all about urban escapism, the things a big city has to offer people with a mad curiosity for life. It’s all pretty subliminal.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Leo Stannard is a dream in every way &#8211; beautiful face, beautiful voice, beautiful songs and all around nice guy.  We catch up with the singer-songwriter to talk about his upcoming album, his tour and his first song about his cat. </em></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-15609" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Leo-High-Res-470x678.jpg" alt="Leo Stannard" width="470" height="678" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Leo-High-Res-470x678.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Leo-High-Res-310x447.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Leo-High-Res-300x433.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Leo-High-Res.jpg 693w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>How would you describe your sound?</em></p>
<p>I suppose on first look I&#8217;m a singer-songwriter but I&#8217;m trying to take that to a whole new place. The raw song will always be the most important thing for me but I’m not scared to experiment in the production as well – a combination of the old and the new.</p>
<p><em>How did you get into song writing?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been writing songs since I was ten years old, so it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve always done. I don&#8217;t know how I got into it – I just always wanted to create stuff. The first song I wrote was about my cat, a classic.</p>
<p><em>What is your song writing process? Do you start with a melody and build up words around it, or do you start with the words and story and then write music to accompany it?</em></p>
<p>I normally get all the melodies in place first and then by that point, I&#8217;m subconsciously singing words with those melodies and that&#8217;s normally a sign of something good. Then I build a concept around that and if it works, I take into the studio. Having a creative structure really helps me.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xDs3Fj-4j9U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><em>Have you been working on an album?</em></p>
<p>I have! I&#8217;ve been working on it since I was 17. The album is the biggest thing for me so I&#8217;m going to make sure it&#8217;s perfect. It&#8217;s going to be a proper journey, not just a random collection of songs.</p>
<p><em>Is it hard to make an album? Did you struggle picking the final song list from all your material?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been planning this since the moment I started to write music so it&#8217;s been a long journey and obviously the song list has evolved massively. I’m writing new songs even now at this late stage of the record, which could feature.</p>
<p><em>You’ve been getting a lot of radio play now – what’s it like to hear yourself on the radio?</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s incredibly humbling. Simple as that. I’m very grateful for some music to be played anywhere.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mrt-UntgdTM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><em>Who are your musical heroes? Have they influenced your own music?</em></p>
<p>A hero for me is Neil Young. He’s definitely influenced me with his pure song writing. I’m constantly listening to Damien Rice, Kendrick Lamar, Claude Debussy, Melody Gardot, Robert Glasper, Snarky Puppy. I&#8217;m not sure if they directly influence the music I write though, I think their drive, fearlessness and creativity is what influences me.</p>
<p><em>London is renowned for its music scene. How has it inspired or developed you as a musician since you moved her?</em></p>
<p>I’m from a very small village near Leicester, and in Ragdale you&#8217;re very much in your own zone, so being in London opens you up to so many more things and that can be very inspiring. You get to mix with people who are in similar positions as you as well, which is great.</p>
<p><em>Where are your favourite music venues and regular haunts?</em></p>
<p>My favourite venue back in Leicester is The Cookie where I&#8217;m actually playing on my UK tour this October. I seem to be spending my time in different places all the time at the moment and in London. My dream is to headline the Royal Albert Hall.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HlbL6udXmf4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><em>You’ve been touring a lot. What’s your favourite thing about performing live?</em></p>
<p>Just playing the songs and connecting with all the people that have come to watch, it&#8217;s an amazing thing. It&#8217;s kind of like a therapy for me as well – pouring out all that emotion makes me feel so much better.</p>
<p><em>What’s been your most memorable moment from your tour so far?</em></p>
<p>When I played in Brussels with Rudimental – that was a crazy night. There were all the terrorist scares around at that point, so there was talk of pulling the show. But in the end everyone decided to go ahead with it and put fear to one side and it was a big moment.</p>
<p><em>You’re from Leicester and they’ve had a pretty phenomenal time lately – are you a football fan? What do you do to relax from music?</em></p>
<p>I used to play for Leicester Academy but music took over sport when I was younger! Football is a great way of getting away from music for a bit, especially if you&#8217;re a Leicester fan!</p>
<p><em>What else can we expect to see from you in the next year?</em></p>
<p>More music, a whole range of collaborations, again pushing my own boundaries when it comes to sound. I’ve got this UK tour in October and I’m getting more and more into live streaming on socials because there are lots of fans from around the world who I need to connect with.</p>

<p><em><strong>How did you all come together to make Anteros?</strong></em></p>
<p>Josh and I have been writing together for the last few years. He was the first person I ever wrote and recorded with. When we decided to start the band, we met Harry (drums) and Charles (guitar) – they joined last summer.</p>
<p><em><strong>Where did the name for the band come from? Obviously the God of Love, but why him?</strong></em></p>
<p>Well, we didn&#8217;t know what kind of project we were writing towards until we wrote <em>Anteros</em> the track. We used it as a reference to London (the statue in the middle of Piccadilly). We’re all from all over the place, but came together in London. The song defined the direction we wanted to go in, and represented us as a band.</p>
<p><em><strong>How would you describe your sound?</strong></em></p>
<p>Bitter Dream Pop.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d5UgKx-smx8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><em><strong>Tell us about your newest song The Beat.</strong></em></p>
<p>I was dumped via text because I was “too busy”. He sent it as I was on my way to the studio with Josh, so I switched my phone off and wrote all the things I wanted to tell him.</p>
<p><em><strong>Who are your musical influences?</strong></em></p>
<p>The list is endless. Our top three would probably be Blur, The Cure and No Doubt.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think are the main components of a good pop track?</strong></em></p>
<p>We’re still trying to figure that out! It’s hard to say as every song is different, and I feel they need to be treated that way. We have a thing for punchy bass lines, surf guitars, quirky drum patterns and upbeat choruses. But who really knows?</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YpE9Du0lMiE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><em><strong>Are you working on an album?</strong></em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s the goal. We never really stop writing, but we&#8217;re taking it one step at a time. We&#8217;re focusing on our EP release and upcoming tour in September.</p>
<p><em><strong>Your videos have a real kitsch element to them – where does that come from?</strong></em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really have the answer to that. All we aim to do is take whoever’s watching into a different world that is fun, light-hearted and full of colour. The guys say it&#8217;s like looking inside my brain&#8230;</p>
<p><em><strong>How much creative input do you have in your videos?</strong></em></p>
<p>We are all as hands on as possible with every step of the process. From the artwork (designed by Josh) to going into mixing and even mastering. The same applies to videos, Josh and I come up with the initial concept. We&#8217;ve worked closely with James &amp; James &#8211; as well as art director Fainche McCardle &#8211; on developing and making it a reality. The guys spend the whole day helping out at video shoots. It&#8217;s a team effort.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MdENOdnxPkc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><em><strong>You’ve been touring this year – what was your favourite gig and why?</strong></em></p>
<p>The more we play, the more we enjoy the gigs. So I&#8217;d probably go with our most recent set at Secret Garden Party. The sun was out, the vibe was right, and the crowd was great.</p>
<p><em><strong>How was Glastonbury?</strong></em></p>
<p>It was the muddiest dream come true. The Other Stage is <em>so big</em>. It was on all of our bucket lists, and none of us had been before, so we went for the whole weekend and had a great time. On the first day we walked over to see the stage we&#8217;d be playing on the Sunday and got very nervous, but the rain stayed away and the set ran smoothly. I think we all realised how much we enjoyed playing a stage that big &#8211; but most of all, now we know that we can. And we want to do it again.</p>
<p><em><strong>What can we expect to see from you for the rest of 2016?</strong></em></p>
<p>Our EP <em>Breakfast</em> is out in September, as well as a mini tour – with our first headline show in London at The Waiting Room on September 26th.</p>

<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><a href="http://www.lefil.co.uk">Le Fil</a> is triple threat! As a model he&#8217;s been featured in Dazed &amp; Confused, i-D and Wallpaper*, as an artist, the Camberwell College of Arts grad has created work for The Barbican, Lady Gaga and English National Ballet andas a musician he released his debut EP &#8216;Pop Sculpture&#8217; in 2015.</p>
<p>Almost exactly a year later, he&#8217;s back with his second album, &#8216;Nightlife&#8217; &#8211; produced by <a href="http://www.frankmusik.com">Frankmusik</a> (Ellie Goulding / Sky Ferreira/ Erasure). &#8216;Nightlife&#8217; launches with the first single off the album &#8216;Genesis&#8217;, an epic futuristic dance-pop song inspired by the notion of the singularity and transhumanism. Le Fil tells us, “the song is about letting go of the past and embracing a better future that we can create for ourselves, whether that’s through coming together as culture, or through music or technology – its an optimistic anthem!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We sat down with Le Fil to chat about gender, his time at UAL and of course his new single Genesis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_14153" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-14153 size-large" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/05/Le-Fil-2-470x470.jpeg" alt="Le Fil 2" width="470" height="470" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/05/Le-Fil-2-470x470.jpeg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/05/Le-Fil-2-150x150.jpeg 150w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/05/Le-Fil-2-310x310.jpeg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/05/Le-Fil-2-768x768.jpeg 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/05/Le-Fil-2-300x300.jpeg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/05/Le-Fil-2.jpeg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Image by Lolo Bates</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The music industry is notoriously dominated by straight males, what&#8217;s it like navigating this space as an androgynous gay person?</strong></p>
<p>I’d say it&#8217;s no different to any other industry, you have your nice guys and your bad guys &#8211; and luckily every straight male I’ve worked with has been amazing. <a href="http://www.frankmusik.com/">Frankmusik</a>, who I’ve worked with on the production for my new EP, is completely straight and totally supports queer artists like Ru Paul and me. And he still gets people calling him gay. It’s swings and roundabouts, everyone has their own challenges and I try not to have this ‘them-against-us&#8217; mentality. We all should be judged for what creativity we bring to the table rather than by our sexual preferences. And being someone that knows how to dominate straight males anyway, its rather quite exciting- haha.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>There’s been such a shift in society&#8217;s views on gender in recent years, this shift is especially visible in the fashion industry, you were even in <a href="http://www.selfridges.com/GB/en/content/agender">Selfridges Agender </a>campaign, do you think a similar shift is occurring in the music industry?</strong></p>
<p>For me, music, fashion and art all fuse into each other so if there’s this seismic shift in one area, it totally has to feed into the other. The notion of a gender utopia is so colourful, that it makes sense to be inclusive. The world can’t stay monochrome with only these polarised depictions of gender within music. We have so many pretty, blonde, straight girls and hunky, straight guys with shaved heads flaunting their heterosexual, hypersexual image, that it’s time for the colourful and exciting ones in between to inject something new into that spectrum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;re a visual artist as well as musical artist, how do you marry/juggle these two mediums ? Why did you choose not to specialise? </strong></p>
<p>I like to bring everything together, hence the title of my first EP ‘Pop Sculpture&#8217;. Even my name Le Fil was chosen because it means ‘the thread’ in French, which to me is like this connection that weaves through all the disciplines and brings them together. It&#8217;s exciting to look at the areas between things, as that’s where there’s something new and undiscovered. The art world allows me to explore my crazy ideas uninhibited, and place them into the world of music which seems like there’s much more barriers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How has what you studied at UAL shaped your practice/who you are as an artist today?</strong></p>
<p>It taught me to look at things in new ways, and gave me confidence to be unconventional in my artistic vision. I also met my core group of friends, who are all creatives and we inspire each other to be the best versions of ourselves. 100% I wouldn’t be here making music if I hadn’t had gone through this self-exploratory phase as an artist. I&#8217;ve come to music a bit later than other people, but hopefully with a lot more understanding of who I am artistically and I think that comes across in everything I do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Genesis is an epic futuristic dance-pop song, what drew you to this genre?</strong></p>
<p>When I wrote Genesis, I was on an artist residency looking at transhumanism and learning about the Singularity, which is where humans integrate with technology. I love that idea of progressing mankind and creating something that improves our world and potential. In my head, its Fifth Element mixed with Matthew Barney’s River of Fundament and channeled with a church hymn! I love an exciting big pop song and Genesis certainly feels epic, especially now that Frankmusik has added his glossiness to it. It’s going to be the first single from my forthcoming Nightlife EP. Well there we go, I just announced the EP title too!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s been almost exactly a year since you dropped your debut EP Pop Sculpture, what’s life been like since?</strong></p>
<p>Pop Sculpture was so exciting for me. Releasing that EP led me to my eight month art residency with this massive company that supported me in making Nightlife. It was also the culmination of so many years, exhibitions and ideas that led to Pop Sculpture, so I’m very proud of the songs like ‘Black’ and ‘Future Is Now’. Especially recently, as I’ve been performing them all with a full live band at shows around London, and it’s been sounding epic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Highlight of your career so far? </strong></p>
<p>My highlight without a doubt is getting to make this new EP. Life as a new musician and artist is a constant hustle, and so many people never get to realise their ideas. It’s not like I’m signed to a label yet, so getting these new songs recorded and released independently is a massive feat for me &#8211; especially with all the talented collaborators I’ve worked with recently on the shows, photographs, videos and the music. Literally, I’m wetting myself over everything about this new EP. I can’t wait for you all to hear it.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Hopes for this year?</strong></p>
<p>That everyone’s gonna be power walking to Genesis on their way to work!</p>

<p>“It’s bloody hard to get a magazine off the ground,” admits <a href="https://twitter.com/pennyjanemartin?lang=en-gb">Penny Martin</a>, editor of women’s fashion and lifestyle magazine <em>The Gentlewoman. </em>What’s even bloody harder than getting a publication to launch is making it one of the most respected titles in a saturated market, an authoritative voice in the industry and a tome of taste, creativity and intelligence. “It’s 15 hour days, no weekends, for months at a time.”</p>
<p>Launched in 2010, <em><a href="http://thegentlewoman.co.uk/">The Gentlewoman</a> </em>was established to “reinstall values in women’s magazine that we felt had been lost” explains Martin. The bi-annual publication from Fantastic Woman Ltd, Gert Jonkers and Jop van Bennekom was a response to the call for a female version of <a href="http://www.fantasticman.com/"><em>Fantastic Man</em> magazine</a> due to the “gap in the market for an intelligent woman’s magazine”. However, Martin was determined that <em>The Gentlewoman </em>wouldn’t be a “spare rib, a side kick” to the renowned men’s publication but an individual title in its own right. In the title, which had been previously used for a Victorian weekly paper and was used to describe an elite class of educated women, Martin saw “the chance to redefine what a gentlewoman is.” Today, she is intelligent, witty, independent and bold.</p>

<p><em>The Gentlewoman </em>debuted during the height of the recession. “I was reading that print journalism was going to die a death,” says Martin, whose straight-talking conversation is refreshing and inspiring. Her direct manner reflects her resolute vision for the magazine, which has never compromised on content, quality or innovation – as Martin says, “We expect a lot and we give a lot.” Through big name profiles, provocative articles and brave editorials – Martin used to be a curator of photographs in national museums and brings her eye to the imagery of the magazine – <em>The Gentlewoman </em>has radically challenged the concept of women’s magazines. “We know we have changed things because people in the industry are copying us. We are copied by really big magazines. It’s never really that nice to see something you almost killed yourself over for six months being used in other magazines.”</p>
<p>Although the magazine “never set out to be a collector’s item”, it’s twice yearly appearance on newsstands, the limited content on the website (Martin firmly attests that the team don’t want to “become a non-stop conversation”) and its timeless subject matter, it has become just that. Add to that mix what Professor King,<a href="http://blogs.arts.ac.uk/london-college-of-communication/2014/02/04/introducing-ual-chair-visual-communication-scott-king/"> UAL Chair of Visual Communication</a>, calls “a sassy seriousness”, and the magazine cements its place as key industry fixture.</p>

<p>Many journalism students hold the dream of launching and leading a hugely successful magazine and Martin has done just that. She does not make it sound easy, but she makes it sound worth the effort. If we are to follow her approach, we must be uncompromising in our vision and approach to work, we must be brave enough to follow our own path and find the most exciting and unique stories, and we must accept only the absolute best of the absolute best. Add to that some wit, talent and a touch of sass, and who knows what we can achieve?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Kenzie May cut her teeth as a backing singer for some of the most exciting names in music, and now she is stepping out with her own music. Her voice is gorgeous and her songs are melodic. We caught up with the singer to talk about third culture kids, collaborations and her amazing song </em>Honey.</p>
<div id="attachment_13812" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-13812 size-large" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/04/NeverFindAnother-470x470.jpg" alt="Kenzie May.

<p><em><strong>How do you describe your sound?</strong></em></p>
<p>I try not to! I think ultimately it is pop music, but I don&#8217;t really know if that counts as a sound. There&#8217;s some soul and organic elements in there, even though it is mainly electronic or synthesised instrumentation. I think there&#8217;s something great about stuff that&#8217;s raw or not overly polished. I like things to have a bit of a rocky edge to them – I like crunch.</p>
<p><em><strong>You’re from Boston, but you were raised in London – how has your mixed upbringing influenced your music and style?</strong></em></p>
<p>I definitely grew up in a kind of &#8216;worlds colliding&#8217; Venn diagram. My family are all American so there are some influences from that side, but I moved to the UK when I was six so there&#8217;s also this deep affinity and collection of memories there. Then there are things that are unique to being a ‘third culture’ kid. You&#8217;re in the middle of both places which ironically makes you an outsider a lot of the time. That kind of forced me to embrace that otherness and try to create a space outside of &#8216;British vs. American&#8217;. A lot of people feel solace in claiming a place, which is cool, but I never really had that. Instead, I just kind of fall in love with everywhere I go, which I think reflects in my music and style and my life in general because I end up picking up references across a pretty broad spectrum.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EaCKVtEyIEs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><em><strong>London is recognised as one of the best cities for emerging musical talent – why do you think that is?</strong></em></p>
<p>People always talk about the massive amount of diversity in London and it&#8217;s so real. It&#8217;s full of transplants who are trying to find their place or create their own – that need to push boundaries and blur lines makes London one of the best places for breeding creativity.</p>
<p><em><strong>When did you first realise you had a gift for song-writing and singing?</strong></em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just always sang. I remember being like nine or ten years old and deciding that no one was going to write songs for me so I&#8217;d just have to do it for myself. It started out just melodies and lyrics and then I started putting chords together on piano or guitar. Vocally, I&#8217;ve definitely grown into my style, but it&#8217;s all been a learning curve.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5BX0eEzvtOI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
<em><strong>Tell us about Honey. We heard the video was inspired by the Nikos Kazantzakis quotation, “Once I saw a bee drown in honey, and I understood”. How is this relevant to the song and how did it come into the video? </strong></em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if it was necessarily inspired by the quote but the two definitely went hand in hand. From the time I wrote the song, I had a vision not dissimilar to the video, which was really cool to see come to fruition, albeit messy as hell. The quote itself is beautiful to me in its tragic implications. It&#8217;s this idea that even something sweet has the ability to destroy you, which is so true of love and relationships. It can be great, but the deeper you go, the harder it is to escape.</p>
<p><em><strong>You’ve worked with some amazing musicians such as Bastille, Metronomy and Sub Focus. Which has been your favourite collaboration and why?</strong></em></p>
<p>Most of the music I work on I see as a collaboration in some respect, whether it be with another artist or songwriter or producers. My favourites change, usually it&#8217;s just the most recent thing I&#8217;ve done, but it&#8217;s been incredible working with so many talented people. The most natural collaboration I would say has probably been with my guys Vindata. They&#8217;re mad talented, super easy going and it&#8217;s always just a good time getting in the studio with them. They recently remixed my song <em>Never Find Another</em>, and it&#8217;s crazy because their style is different to mine, but it just works. They just get it.</p>

Image via Dawbell</p></div>
<p><em><strong>Who else would you love to work with in the future?</strong></em></p>
<p>The list is ever-growing. There are a lot of musicians I&#8217;d love to just get in a room with, and I have a lot of talented friends I look forward to creating stuff with. I&#8217;m all for organic interactions when it comes to making music. If it&#8217;s meant to happen, it will.</p>
<p><em><strong>Will you be launching an album soon? If so, what can we expect?</strong></em></p>
<p>More music coming soon, and some kind of long play will definitely be happening sooner than later. I&#8217;ve been working on some stuff that I&#8217;m really stoked on.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you have plans to tour?</strong></em></p>
<p>For sure, when I can drag myself away from the studio. The live shows are going to be special.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Behind Vetements’ £400 oversize hoodies and four </i></span><i style="line-height: 1.5">figure chopped jeans is <i style="line-height: 1.5">Demna and Guram Gvasalia</i> &#8211; two brothers from Georgia, with a business model that has seen them rise to the top of the industry in just under two years. Now they&#8217;re ready to revolutionise the system and want you all to come along for the ride.</i></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15985" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/03/MG_2984.jpg" alt="_MG_2984" width="1326" height="775" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/03/MG_2984.jpg 1326w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/03/MG_2984-310x181.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/03/MG_2984-768x449.jpg 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/03/MG_2984-470x275.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/03/MG_2984-600x351.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1326px) 100vw, 1326px" /></p>
<p>It is not a groundbreaking business model, but it is one built on steady foundations, depicted as a simple but structurally sound Roman temple by Guram Gvasalia &#8211; the CEO &#8211; at his talk ‘Collective Action’ hosted by London College of Fashion.</p>
<p>Guram is the business side of the partnership, the numbers man, while his brother Demna brings concept and design to the brand. Guram has an arguably less glamorous role but it was his experience in business and Vetements&#8217; business model that host Sarah Mower wanted to tackle and share with the audience of students from London’s top fashion institutions. “We’re here to talk fashion business, the fundamentals of the fashion industry and how they should change for the future, for your futures.”</p>
<p>Mower went on to discuss the state of the industry at a point where access to information has never been so easy or so fast, where celebrity endorsement sells shoes and our attention spans are dropping. “We’re seeing unprecedented chaos in the industry. Hysteria over ‘see now buy now’, the insane pace of fashion and the impact of social media.”</p>
<p>Vetements have spun controversy and success in equal measure, recently announcing that they would merge their men’s and women’s show into one, and move it to coincide with the pre-collections schedule of January and June. “Doing one show is more cost effective. Also doing one show is closer to reality, boys and girls together. The people these days they can choose their own gender. The clothes have the gender.”</p>
<p>We’re unearthing their success. This is Vetements by numbers&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Harness the right side of your brain</strong><br />
Fashion is not built on creativity and fun alone. Guram studied at top business schools in Law and business in Germany before moving to London to study Fashion Marketing at London College of Fashion. His intense education in business and his German upbringing has made him level headed, good with numbers and organised &#8211; “when I moved to Paris I realised how organised German culture makes you without even realising.”</p>
<p><strong>2. Keep it real</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fashion tries to sell a dream rather than reality.&#8221; says Guram, and </span></strong>Vetements sells reality, he continues. Arguably an expensive kind of reality, one built on clothes that are imperfect and playful and catwalk shows (intimate and one row only) where the clothes are modelled by mates.</p>
<p><strong>3. Work with good stores</strong><br />
“It was a lot of calling, a lot of rejection.” Gvasalia says of trying to secure stores at the beginning. a Personal phone call &#8211; he and Demna made nearly 500 &#8211; is his advice. “It&#8217;s not about the quantity of stores. It&#8217;s about the quality of the stores you’re working with and at a certain point their budgets.”</p>
<p><strong>4. You need manufacturers you can trust</strong></p>
<p>Vetements take a hardline when it comes to working with manufacturers. Work on a contract basis and with a lawyer you can trust. Manufacturers have to pay penalties if they don’t deliver.</p>
<p><strong>5. Demand 30% prepayment, 30% before delivery</strong><br />
“Getting the money from stores afterwards is very difficult. Thirty percent is not a lot of money but it&#8217;s an [important] commitment. If people refuse to give you the thirty percent it means there is something dodgy going on and you need to be careful.” And pay your manufacturers early or on time in return.</p>
<p><strong>6. Work with family, create family</strong><br />
Matches and Ssense are good examples of brands built on marriages, sibling partnerships, and that produce stronger families around them. Guram said “The problem with big structures is the buyers change so frequently, there is no consistency.” During delivery time at the Vetements he said ‘everyone from the design team comes to the warehouse, everyone from the commercial team comes to the warehouse and we pack all together… People from design team go to the showroom and actually sells, because they have a different story to tell.”</p>
<p><strong>7. Get, or be, a good Product and Production Manager</strong><br />
This is the most important and difficult role to fill in a company. Guram says “Italian [speaking] is a bonus. They&#8217;re difficult to find and get paid three or five times more than designers.”</p>
<p><strong>8. Be careful with distributors or do your own sales</strong><br />
Working with bad distributors can lead to your brand being stocked in ‘horrible stores’. “I was in Japan and was buying a bento box in a store. And I said to the person working there “it looks like a fake Margiela bag” then I realised it was a real one and it stocked a huge amount of Margiela.”</p>
<p><strong>9. Cap quantities</strong><br />
“Luxury was always something that was scarce.” said Guram. Nowadays luxury is mass produced in China. Vestments returns to more traditional notions of luxury, producing limited edition runs. “When the items are sold out they&#8217;re sold out.” Guram said. “We have thousands of requests for the hoodies. If we did them again we could sell a million in a day but we don’t and it&#8217;s out of respect for the people that got the hoodies, who can cherish the hoodies.”</p>
<p><strong>10. Don’t just follow suit</strong><br />
Guram admitted that “The Industry needs to change.” Production to delivery times are not realistic within the current fashion calendar. Do what you can cope with, rather than conforming to the systems in place. And although Guram backtracked on the inta ‘see now, buy now’ model, which he had spoken out about in the press before, he believed in finding ways to move forward. “There is an amazing person who created all these rules Pierre Bergé, and I respect him a lot and it was fifty years ago, and since him no one has come and said “look you know let&#8217;s update the industry.” We’re in 2016 and probably we need to have modern ways of doing things.”</p>
<p>“Start speaking out about things. Because once you’ve become part of the corporate structure you forget about these things. So while you are still free from the people telling you what to do you can build your own opinions &#8211; about what is the right thing and what is the wrong thing. Ask why do we need to play a game that doesn’t make sense.”</p>
