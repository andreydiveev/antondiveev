				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To celebrate the launch of their highly anticipated <a href="http://www.selfridges.com/GB/en/content/article/body-studio">Body Studio</a>, Selfridges commissioned incredible director <a href="http://www.kathrynferguson.co.uk">Kathryn Ferguson</a> to create a short film. &#8216;Incredible Machines&#8217; that talks about women and their relationship with underwear.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rmaNcRj-Wd4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The film, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmaNcRj-Wd4">Incredible Machines</a>”, flips conventional women’s underwear advertising on it’s head, kicking back against the use of unrealistic, hyper-sexualised imagery of women, and pushing for a more diverse and body positive model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kathryn explains that &#8220;for so long underwear advertising has been dominated by sexualised imagery of women in heightened poses and impossible designs. When in reality, this is worlds apart from the everyday act of putting on your pants and the choices we make in the morning. I hope the film helps to cut through the noise and show amazing women appearing stripped back, as they are, speaking truthfully. All five have achieved great things and for that reason I wanted to go back to basics &#8211; finding out how they felt about themselves. I would love people to feel inspired by these women; leaving them more positive and celebratory of their own bodies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was honoured to be asked to be one of these 5 women and stood alongside the iconic muse and Rick Owens collaborator- <a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/">Michele Lamy</a>, the original boss lady and founder of WAH Nails <a href="https://twitter.com/sharmadeanreid?lang=en-gb">Sharmadean Reid</a> MBE, the stunning model and body activist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/naomishimada/?hl=en">Naomi Shimada</a>, and British Thai boxing champion and designer of the hijab activewear range <a href="http://www.ruqsana-begum.com/">Ruqsana Begum,</a> as we talked about our relationship with underwear and our bodies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The film celebrates womanhood and the female form in all its beautiful manifestations while touching on some ugly topics like the male gaze, the sexualisation of trans women and body shaming. While traditional underwear adverts air brush and edit, Kathryn refused to Photoshop our bodies or our identities. Instead she celebrates the beauty in the imperfections and highlights the facets of our identities and stories most beauty campaigns would find too ugly or uncomfortable to promote. She doesn’t slim down the size 16, add breasts to the flat chested, or smooth the wrinkles &#8211; she embraces and celebrates all these things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So many brands and directors jump on the body positivity hype and the diversity bandwagon, <a href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/2016/03/transtrender-2-0/">churning out click-bait campaigns</a> with a line-up of white women, chucking in a woman of colour or a size 16 woman and try to sell that as diversity and body positivity. That isn’t diversity, that isn’t body positivity, that’s <em>insulting</em>. Kathryn Ferguson truly cares about these issues and you can see and feel this when you watch the film, or any of her films for that matter. The film truly reflects the different walks of womanhood including women of colour, older women, curvy women, Muslim women and trans women- all of whom are often excluded from fashion and beauty advertising.</p>
<p>We were all made to feel beautiful and empowered and hopefully women watching it will feel just as beautiful and empowered, and most importantly represented.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is body positivity done right, this is diversity done right, this is advertising done right!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re carrying on the drag theme for P&amp;P Beauty this week, because<a href="http://www.logotv.com/video-clips/eh1as0/rupauls-drag-race-extended-first-look"> Ru Pauls Drag Race</a> is back.</p>
<p>Here we&#8217;ve put together a list of our top 10 beauty queens; the realest of the real and the femme de la femme a lá Ru Paul&#8217;s Drag Race.</p>
<p><strong>10) Miss Fame</strong></p>
<p>In her own words she&#8217;s &#8220;beyond this planet beautiful&#8221; nobody beats a face like Fame.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/6e/50/de/6e50de8c858e2abb288ef1c966545f42.gif" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>9) Roxxxy Andrews</strong></p>
<p>Miss Roxxxy may go for the more painted, less &#8220;real&#8221; look &#8211; but them curves are all real honey, no foam hereee!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://images.yuku.com.s3.amazonaws.com/image/gif/ceb16c64fef609acd95e308296d5705d3133b3f4_r.gif" alt="" width="500" height="270" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>8) Courtney Act</strong></p>
<p>3 words; &#8216;Chapstick and mascara&#8217;&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://courtneyact.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/pitcrewpillow.gif" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7) Jade Jolie</strong></p>
<p>Miss Jade Jolie took realness to another level- not only did she look like a girl, she sounded like a damn girl- that laugh was everything.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/d3086fab09dc8997bf0df4afbab910e1/tumblr_mhcsx4DyyD1rthi3ao1_400.gif" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6) Trinity Kardashian Bonet</strong></p>
<p>The Queen of the lip-sync, Miss TKB was one of the most consistent performers on the runway- serving up breath taking looks week after week.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://49.media.tumblr.com/696c161deebf103847dd8262235d4d68/tumblr_n5jf4czHeM1rosb88o1_500.gif" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5) April Carrion</strong></p>
<p>Though the Puerto Rican beauty sashayed away WAY to early, during the short amount of time she was around April proved herself to be one of the most beautiful (and creative) queens to ever grace Drag Race.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://49.media.tumblr.com/5fd04243827fb28260d47197fe69824a/tumblr_nm15o7jGx21s6sc4lo1_500.gif" alt="" width="500" height="335" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4) Vivienne Pinay</strong></p>
<p>In her owns &#8220;the fishiest Queen, today, tomorrow, next month, the past seasons and the seasons to come&#8221;, and what she lacks in modesty she makes up for in face.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/efa7c206579a7e31ffa3e8c911fef769/tumblr_meujz3BHha1qbzqexo1_500.gif" alt="" width="500" height="280" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3) Tatianna</strong></p>
<p>The OG &#8220;fishy&#8221; girl, all the way back in season 2, she set the bar for realness and only a few have challenged her for her crown since. She&#8217;s also set to be on Allstars 2 so we&#8217;ll get to gag on her beauty all over again!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzyizsmdvy1r1emlm.gif" alt="" width="500" height="385" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2) Kenya Michaels</strong></p>
<p>The 5 foot Puerto Rican beauty is hands down one of the most real queens that ever graced drag race, and now she IS real. Since the show she&#8217;s gone on to transition. Good for you Miss Kenya.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://lovesujeiry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Overdressed-RuPaul-Drag-Race.gif" alt="" width="500" height="300" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1) Carmen Carrera</strong></p>
<p>The Queen of face (and ass), like Kenya Carmen also identifies as transgender now. Miss Carrera is not only one of the most beautiful girls from drag race but also one of the most successful &#8211; she&#8217;s gone on to sign with Elite Models and was even tipped to be the first Victoria&#8217;s Secret Angel.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://49.media.tumblr.com/43ed8f28b303573107aa0ddefb17b7f0/tumblr_n21yxnWJW31tulrsfo1_400.gif" alt="" width="500" height="281" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>After hearing the news that Caitlyn Jenner is going to be the new face of <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/juliareinstein/caitlyn-jenner-is-the-new-face-of-hms-sportswear-line#.ohd5QvGYo">H&amp;M’s sportswear line</a>, I’ve been inspired to return to my <a href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/2015/11/transtrender/">Transtrender</a> piece. My article explored the increasing use of trans models in fashion. It questioned whether this signified a shift in the industry’s and society’s perception of trans people, or whether trans people are just being used as a marketing tool. In the 6 months since the article I want to see  whether much has changed. </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s not surprising to me that H&amp;M have cast Caitlyn as the face of their sportswear line, because firstly Caitlyn is a gold medalist Olympian and secondly, and perhaps more importantly, trans is still trendy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_13255" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-13255 size-large" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/03/1-1-470x313.jpg" alt="1" width="470" height="313" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/03/1-1-470x313.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/03/1-1-310x207.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/03/1-1-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/03/1-1-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/03/1-1.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Caitlyn Jenner X H&amp;M</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve seen several trans focused campaigns from brands such as <a href="http://stylenews.peoplestylewatch.com/2016/01/03/jaden-smith-is-the-new-face-of-louis-vuitton/">Louis Vuitton</a>, <a href="http://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/fashion/celebrity-fashion/2016/01/best-fashion-campaigns-2016-celebrity-and-designer-campaigns/viewgallery/1607110">Uniqlo</a> and <a href="http://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/30213/1/zara-debuts-ungendered-clothing-range">Zara</a>, some of which have received mixed responses both championing their diversity while also questioning their motives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zara in particular received a lot of criticism for their recent <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/03/07/zara-ungendered-clothing-line_n_9397692.html">“Ungendered” clothing line</a>, with critics saying that if they really wanted to be progressive and do the whole ungendered thing they would simply remove the gender labels on their existing garments. It’s a good point. However they know that trans is trendy and launching a collection like this will get them press and make them money.</p>
<div id="attachment_13254" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-13254 size-large" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/03/o-ZARA-UNGENDERED-900-470x582.jpg" alt="o-ZARA-UNGENDERED-900" width="470" height="582" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/03/o-ZARA-UNGENDERED-900-470x582.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/03/o-ZARA-UNGENDERED-900-310x384.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/03/o-ZARA-UNGENDERED-900-768x951.jpg 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/03/o-ZARA-UNGENDERED-900-300x372.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/03/o-ZARA-UNGENDERED-900.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Zara&#8217;s &#8216;Ungendered&#8217; collection</p></div>
<p>Companies want credit for being progressive but it is undeniable that business comes into it. It is chicken and the egg; what came first the good intention or the business intention.</p>
<p>H&amp;M in comparison has a good track record with the trans community. They recently cast trans models Hari Nef and Andreja Pejic in their fashion week show and their sister brand &amp; Other Stories recently had an all trans cast and crew for their <a href="http://www.elle.com/fashion/news/a29864/other-stories-launches-transgender-campaign/">“The Gaze”</a> campaign last year. This makes their new Caitlyn Jenner campaign and their support of the trans community seem more genuine and authentic and less trendy, as opposed to the brands jumping on the whole “ungendered” hype; all trend and no substance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_13253" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-13253" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/03/a919d114-df6c-4146-942c-bd1e598d549b-2060x1236-470x282.jpeg" alt="Press unik 2 (main Pic) 001" width="470" height="282" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/03/a919d114-df6c-4146-942c-bd1e598d549b-2060x1236-470x282.jpeg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/03/a919d114-df6c-4146-942c-bd1e598d549b-2060x1236-310x186.jpeg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/03/a919d114-df6c-4146-942c-bd1e598d549b-2060x1236-768x461.jpeg 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/03/a919d114-df6c-4146-942c-bd1e598d549b-2060x1236-300x180.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The all-transCast and crew of the &amp; Other Stories &#8220;The Gaze&#8221; campaign</p></div>
<p>I’ll be honest and say perhaps, as a trans person, I’m being too hard on these brands. I complain when trans models aren’t used and I complain when trans models are used, I know. Don’t get me wrong, I think it’s amazing that trans people are finally being represented positively in fashion, I just hope the support lasts longer than most trends do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I concluded my original <a href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/2015/11/transtrender/">Transtrender</a> article saying that I look forward to the day where trans models are used but it’s not even mentioned that they are trans- that’s when I’ll know for sure we are more than a marketing ploy and more importantly that’s when I’ll know we are equal. 6 months on and we’re still waiting for that day, and I’d say it’ll still be a good while before we see it- but at least we’re moving in the right direction.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Barbie, the cultural icon/kids toy depending on how you view her, turned 57 last week.</p>
<p>And with age comes wisdom and Mattel has recently made a move towards a more diverse line up of Barbie dolls.</p>
<p>Last month a plus size Barbie was featured on the cover of <a href="http://time.com/barbie-new-body-cover-story/">TIME magazine</a>, debuting the brand&#8217;s  new range that now includes dolls of a variety of different skin tones, hair types, heights and weights. Mattel say it’s their bid to reflect a broader view of beauty and promote healthy and realistic self image. With increasing body image issues amongst pre-pubescent children, we think this is great (and long overdue).</p>
<p>But as with everything these days there was a social media backlash with phrases like &#8216; toy, not a role model&#8217;, &#8216;political correctness gone mad&#8217; and &#8216;putting adult hangups onto to children&#8217; being bandied about.</p>
<p>But what do you think?</p>
<p>Until you&#8217;ve been unrepresented yourself you will never know how valuable and affirming it is to see yourself reflected, especially growing up, be that on TV, in fashion or even in a doll.</p>
<p>We need to move away from an industry where one body type is the ideal. Our catwalks, magazines and adverts need to be more representative of women&#8217;s bodies and so should our toy shops.Mattel say they have launched this range so that girls can find a doll that speaks to them, and we think that’s beautiful.</p>
<p>Life in plastic, is (finally) fantastic. Happy Birthday Barbie.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Originally an architect, MA Footwear grad <a href="http://showtime.arts.ac.uk/JaydaHany">Jayda Hany</a> seeks to enhance the structural strength of catwalk shoes to make them more wearable. Her method involves deconstructing the internal components of the shoe by exteriorising impact on walking gait through exploring structural architecture such as truss systems and load distribution. Aiming to create structural footwear that combines architectural techniques, traditional footwear making and 3D Printing technology, in this collection the sole units and heels are composed of a joint and members cross bracing structural system that utilises tensile and compressive forces in footwear construction. The sole units convey a relationship of transparency between the shoe as a product and the user where the user is able to clearly view how sole unit elements are successfully connected, and how the shoe as a whole is assembled.</p>
<p><em>“I have always viewed a shoe as a mobile structure that is carrying the human body. I noticed the strong relationship between my past profession as an architect, footwear and fashion as a whole. Consequently, I developed my personal interest as a designer in clarity and constructivism. I always emphasise on the detailing of assembly and connections . I generated my identity as a futuristic designer who has an eye for structure and respect for the traditional making techniques”</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Fashion and feminism have had a fractious past but on this <a href="http://www.internationalwomensday.com">International Women’s Day</a> we celebrate the relationship between the two.</em></p>
<p>Fashion has played an integral role in the fight for equal rights for women throughout history, yet is too often dismissed as frivolous and even detrimental to feminism. From the Suffragettes&#8217; purple, white and green ensembles to Pussy Riot’s balaclavas, fashion has been used to empower, build unity and force change at every stage of the feminist movement.</p>
<p>However, it’s not so much about the garments themselves but what they have been used to say. Power dressing, under-dressing, costume, religious dress, covering up. stripping off- these aren’t fashion statements, but rather statements made using fashion.</p>
<p>Fashion is political, fashion is powerful.</p>
<p>So this International Women’s Day let’s use the power of fashion and more so the power within each and every one of us to bring about the change we want to see in the world. And of course let us remember the incredible women who have paved the way for us. Here are a few quotes from some of them, because they can say it so much better than we can.</p>
<p>Happy International Women’s Day!</p>

<p>&#8220;Well behaved women rarely make history&#8221; – Laurel Thatcher Ulrich</p>
<p>“Extremists have shown what frightens them most: a girl with a book.” — Malala Yousafzai</p>
<p>“I am no bird; and no net ensnares me: I am a free human being with an independent will.” ― Charlotte Brontë</p>
<p>“As a woman I have no country. As a woman I want no country. As a woman, my country is the whole world.” ― Virginia Woolf</p>
<p>“It’s the fire in my eyes, And the flash of my teeth, The swing in my waist, And the joy in my feet. I’m a woman. Phenomenally.” ― Maya Angelou</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LGBT History Month, which has just come to an end, is an opportunity for us to celebrate how far we have come as a community but the fight is far from over children. While we may have equal rights here in the UK, we are still far from equal.</p>
<p>This was proven in the government’s recent <a href="http://transinquiry.co.uk">Transgender Equality Inquiry</a>, which found that GPs are regularly breaking the law by refusing to treat trans patients. I know this first hand because I’ve been refused treatment by my GP.</p>
<p>I was in a dark place pre-transition and woke up most days contemplating suicide. I went to my GP for help and was surprised to discover that he didn&#8217;t know what the word transgender meant and <em>even more</em> surprised with how he treated me once I explained what it did mean.</p>
<p>He moved away from me, looked at me in disgust and told me there was nothing he nor the NHS could do to help me and sent me away. I later found out he didn&#8217;t even put on my record that I&#8217;d been to see him.</p>
<p>I had to see another two GPs before I found one who was decent enough to, you know, treat me like a human being and do their job. Although even then she didn&#8217;t actually know what to do with a trans patient and I had to inform her of the next steps.</p>
<p>I did appreciate that she was at least respectful and open, but it is sad that I should have be grateful that a GP respects me enough to do their job. It is also sad that even when GPs aren’t being blatantly transphobic, there’s still a large majority who don’t how to treat us.</p>
<p>This is why I have taken action and set up a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/nhs-england-end-transphobia-in-the-nhs-teach-gp-s-how-to-deal-with-trans-patients?recruiter=67972999&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink">petition</a> urging the General Medical Council to make trans patient treatment a compulsory part of the GP curriculum. The support I have received for the petition has been overwhelming. It garnered 30,000 signatures in under a week, but the more signatures it gets the more seriously the petition will be taken, so if you have 10 seconds please sign and share.</p>
<p>You don’t have to be trans to sign &#8211; you just have to believe in equality. This isn&#8217;t about special rights, it’s about human rights.</p>
<p>Thank you so, so much for your support.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The BBC launched a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/get-inspired/bodypositive">#BodyPositivity</a> initiative in January that aims to inspire and empower each other to feel happy, healthy and confident in our bodies by sharing our stories of self love and acceptance. Celebrities like Rebecca Adlington,  Paloma Faith and Nicola Adams alongside people from all walks of life including plus sized folk, disabled folk and trans folk have all all shared their stories. There is a narrative we can all relate to which is why the project is so amazing.</p>
<p>As a trans girl <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/bodypositive/35345075">the video of Evie</a>, was the one I could relate to most. Like Evie, I have an interesting story with body positivity. Since puberty I detested my body and there has been points in my life where I&#8217;ve been close to suicide because of how I look. But when I realised I was trans, this intense self-hatred suddenly made sense and now that I understood the root of the problem I have been able to work on myself and learn to love myself.</p>
<p>It took almost 2 years from the point I realised I was trans until I received the hormones to begin medically transitioning but in that period I learnt to love myself unconditionally</p>
<p>As a trans person so early on in transition, when my body is still looks very much male, loving myself can be seen as a revolutionary act.</p>
<p>This is what self love and body positivity is about- accepting yourself as you are, not accepting yourself only when you&#8217;ve lost ten pounds, or had a nose job, or had a sex change.</p>
<div style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="http://images.intouchweekly.com/uploads/images/file/5482/honey-boo-boo-1.gif?fit=crop&amp;w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Image credit &#8211; http://images.intouchweekly.com</p></div>
<p>This might sound hard, but honey, if I&#8217;m able to love myself as woman in a man&#8217;s body- then you can most definitely love yourself too!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a journey, take the first step today.</p>

<div>Meet Luke and Mandy.</div>
<div>Luke is a photographer.</div>
<div>Mandy is a model.</div>
<div>Luke and Mandy are in a relationship.</div>
<div>Luke photographs Mandy for their project <a href="http://lukeandmandy.com/#!/3/featured/View_Gallery/181">Two Souls</a>.</div>
<div>We love it.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><span style="color: black">&#8220;The series documents our journey together and our relationship through Luke&#8217;s camera. Each image has deeper, private meaning to us personally. </span>We started the project a year ago and have shot imagery for it in over 10 countries so far, and plan to travel further afield this year. We believe part of what makes our art so unique and engaging is the story behind the image and the challenging conditions we take to create it, be it venturing into derelict and crumbling buildings, working in extreme weather conditions or literally ducking and diving to hide from security guards whilst shooting in forbidden locations. We plan to continue the series for the rest of our lives.&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div>The two give new meaning power couple.</div>
