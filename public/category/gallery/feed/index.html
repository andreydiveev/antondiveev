<div></div>
<div><em>Within the kaleidoscopic pattern of the Chartres Cathedral’s western rose window is an age old artist expression of the Last Judgment. It speaks of finality and eternality, a line that leaves no space for turning back once crossed. The fashion world is bound by unspoken rules and boundaries, unseen lines that designers work desperately to cross every day. This collection takes inspiration from the window and pushes the once sacred image into an expression of individualism. The dress departs from conventional standards of ready to wear fashion, challenging our modern senses by mixing in medieval and gothic elements. It serves as a reminder that even as we move into a dizzying age of technological sophistication where everything seems possible with the touch of our fingertips, a part of us will always be shadowed by the past, caged in by the grills of our self imposed conventions.</em></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hanna Puskarz, photographer and one half of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/handzaround/">@HandZaround</a> interviewed <a href="https://www.lalaloveworld.com">Lalalove</a> founder and designer, Linda Choroenlab during her world travels.</p>

<p><strong><em>How did Lalalove start? We read on you blog that it all started in London, </em><em>at the Portobello Road Market.</em></strong></p>
<p>Do you wanna have the real real story, or made up story to make it sound good?</p>
<p><strong><em>The real one!</em></strong></p>
<p>There are two stories &#8211; one is the good one and one is the real one. The real one starts from [the moment of my] study at LCF. I was studying styling and photography and actually, I really wanted to be a stylist. At the time I worked in a Thai restaurant. Like everyone in London, you needed to work part-time to pay the rent… or to do whatever.</p>
<p>When I worked in a Thai restaurant, it wasn’t related to what I wanted to do at all, and it wasn’t really bringing me anything. I managed to get a job at Gucci during the period I was studying styling and photography. After that, when I graduated, I worked in Moschino in visual merchandise. I didn’t want to do that, however it was related to my subject, but I thought it was better than doing anything else. I still wanted to be a stylist, so I did lots of test shoots and I worked as an intern at Dazed and Confused. But it was all for free, you didn’t get paid. I did lookbooks for Maria Francesca Pepe, Gareth Pugh…but we never got paid…</p>
<p><strong><em>Such big people and they don&#8217;t have money…</em></strong></p>
<p>Really big people and they don&#8217;t get that I need to work in the shop to earn something. I was like ‘Hey, what I earn is not enough, after I pay the rent, I struggle a lot!’ So I was thinking what can I do to have more time, to do styling, to earn money… I am not a designer, but I thought I could maybe design a t-shirt. I sent a file to Bangkok, so they could do a silk screen print for me on a tshirt, and they sent it back here, to London. That was the beginning of my career as a designer. I didn’t really consider myself a designer, because I felt I was a stylist, but I thought I could do it as a hobby.  I tried to get a store in Portobello Market, but it was really difficult to get one because they have a system there, similar to one in the mafia… You need to pay cash to the people; you need to wait in the queue. I pretended to be a really innocent Thai girl…and I got the stall! I started to sell there regularly, but it was so tough! I didn’t sell the t-shirts for cheap. I designed the prints myself so I charged about £20 for a t-shirt. After some time, I also opened a stall in the Spitalfields Market. I worked every Saturday and Sunday and it was really hard. People of the new generation don&#8217;t understand how hard it is… They think everything so easy. You don&#8217;t have any money, you have two big suitcases you have to get on the bus, then wait in the queue for your stall, and you might get the stall on the day or not…you don&#8217;t even know. It just turns out at the spot. You just have to wait for the decision because you are new.</p>
<p><strong><em>So how did it all evolve into more than selling at the stall?</em></strong></p>
<p>After some time I had Japanese buyers come to buy in Portobello in wholesale. I didn’t even know what wholesale was. It was a learning process. After a year, a distributor from Italy came across my stall. They wanted to resell my t-shirts. I didn’t know much about it but I was lucky &#8211; I was able to turn to my friends. In the end, my t-shirts were selling at a department store in Italy for about €80 each! So I quit Moschino because I had enough money to do styling for free.</p>
<p><strong><em>So how did that all work out after you quit Moschino?</em></strong></p>
<p>It was good! I did a lot of styling and eventually I got an offer to be a fashion editor for Wallpaper Magazine, Thai edition. I did that also for Dazed &amp; Confused Japan, everything was going okay.</p>
<p>Then I had a baby, Lulu. After I gave birth, it was difficult because I didn’t have my family to be with me all the time. My husband’s family came to see us<br />
once or twice a week but it was different to the Thai culture &#8211; Asian family helps you a lot with taking care of the baby. I couldn’t do styling because I had to take care of Lulu, so my family suggested moving back to Thailand for a while. My family really supports my career and so I decided to move back for a while. It meant I could do collections and hire people to help me so I can also do styling. In the meantime my family helps me with taking care of Lulu whilst my husband, Mark, who is a musician, goes back and forth every 6 weeks between England and Bangkok.</p>
<p><strong><em>So how did it all move on since you returned to Bangkok?</em></strong></p>
<p>At the beginning it was just ok. But then lots of things started to happen &#8211; working as a stylist, billboards for departments stores, magazines. Then Topshop noticed <em>Lalalove</em> and we were selling in Topshop in London’s Oxford Street for three years. We don’t do it anymore though. It’s too much going on here! I now have a <em>Lalalove</em> store in Siam Paragon Shopping Centre.</p>
<p><strong><em>So that’s how Lalalove was born! Did you have to change your audience </em><em>when you moved to Bangkok? In the UK the fashions are different than </em><em>here.</em></strong></p>
<p>Actually, I never compromise with my style at all. In Siam Center, mainly tourists buy my things, Chinese or European. But actually I don&#8217;t care. If Thai people don&#8217;t buy it, I don&#8217;t give a damn, I&#8217;m not going to pretend to sell lace or pastels. I would get so bored.</p>
<p><em style="font-weight: bold">You don&#8217;t need to compromise! It seems like there is a whole new audience for you now!</em> <strong><em>What are you inspirations? Lalalove looks so colourful, and full of life.</em></strong></p>
<p>I really love positive things. Actually I love nature and I love animals. I love flowers. I Really want to be positive and colourful because at the moment the world is stressful enough. I don’t want to be bothered with all that shit! I want to be nice and colourful, and make people smile. This is my brand.</p>
<p><em style="font-weight: bold">Can you tell us about the Pa Kao Ma Collection? I love that it is inspired </em><em style="font-weight: bold">by the Thai culture. You use original Thai fabrics produced in rural areas.</em> <strong><em>Can you tell us some more about that?</em></strong></p>
<p>Yes! The government contacted me. They do collaborations with high fashion Thai brands, but usually with the very traditional ones. And they asked me to collaborate with them, I don&#8217;t know what on earth they were thinking!</p>
<p><strong><em>But you agreed, and it all worked out! What was it all about?</em></strong></p>
<p>Deep in my heart I really like nature, so I want to be sustainable. But this project was supposed to be just for the fashion show. In Thailand we have artists and designers, who collaborate just for the fashion shows and then the projects are over. I really disagree with it, because it&#8217;s such a waste of time. When I got the collaboration offer, I started to research why Thai people don’t buy traditional Thai silk anymore. Why does the new generation not wear it? What’s the problem?<br />
The government pays the designers money to do the fashion show and then it’s all in press and that’s it. And then what, they promise to the village to buy Thai silk, they give them money once but do they ever buy more? Do they buy every month? The villagers really hope to improve their situation and if they get paid only once it doesn’t really keep the Thai economy growing.</p>
<p>I expressed my opinion and tried to talk to them, but because it’s their idea I couldn’t say much to change it. We were almost finished with the collection for the fashion show and then the next day the King passed away…I then got a call from the government that the project will be cancelled. I told them ‘why cancel’? They already spent a lot of money and I made the collection.<br />
They said we can’t go on with the fashion show because the King passed away. I tried to prove them that this is not what the King would want. He wouldn’t want them to spend all this money for nothing. I suggested spending the rest of the money not on the fashion show but on doing a look book, PR and spreading the word, because we worked very hard on making this combination of sustainable Thai fabric and quirky street wear… We went to the village by ourselves to talk to the people, who make the fabric, who yarn. They only do it part-time because it doesn’t bring them enough money. So they work as farmers the rest of the time. However, if we ordered every month or two, this could become their full-time career. So I said to the government ‘If you want to cancel, I will still charge you 100%.’</p>
<p><strong><em>Did the fashion week happen?</em></strong></p>
<p>No, the fashion week didn’t happen but it’s actually good because I could use the money to do a really nice look book and towards the trade show abroad, not just in Thailand. We’re going to Japan for Tokyo Fashion Week.<br />
I think the more Thai people can see our collection showcased abroad, the more they will consider it cool and will go back to support it. If we got Pa Kao Ma to sell in a store abroad, people in Thailand would want to wear it themselves. They would be inspired by the fashion abroad &#8211; Paris, London, Berlin, wherever. So getting Pa Kao Ma there would help the young Thai generation to see that this is not fucked up, this is cool and you can wear it!<br />
I am not religious and I don’t go to temples, but this is what I can do for my country. I love my country and this is what I can do, being myself.</p>
<p><strong><em>Change the world in your own way!</em></strong></p>
<p>Exactly, in my own way. There are 1000 villages in Thailand, I am the only brand, who started to work with them. I cannot use fabrics from all the 1000 villages but if you’re a new designer, don’t fly to Paris to see ‘the best world’. Go to Chiang Rai first. See what they have. Economy will grow! Thai people need to be together to help each other. Not just think ‘Paris is fucking cool’. No!</p>
<p><strong><em>What do you consider to be your biggest achievement?</em></strong></p>
<p>My biggest achievement is happiness. I don&#8217;t need lots of money. The happiness comes from people wearing my clothes and using them to express themselves. And another thing is having more time with my daughter.</p>
<p><strong><em>So when you see someone walking on the street wearing your clothes,</em> <em>what do you do?</em></strong></p>
<p>I run and hug them, and say: ‘Thank you, thank you! OMG thank you! Can I take a picture with you!’. I am so over the moon. I think I will be like this forever.</p>
<p><strong><em>What has been the biggest difficulty on your journey?</em></strong></p>
<p>Dealing with people! Always people!</p>
<p><strong><em>How do you deal with the people who are on different wavelength than</em> <em>you in the fashion world?</em></strong></p>
<p>I try to close my eyes. If the money is not good to deal with, I don’t deal with it. No time for drama. It&#8217;s good though, because in my industry I have my good friends. We see a lot people, who are really selfish in fashion, and in other fields. They&#8217;ve got to survive, but don&#8217;t do too much. Everyone wants to be rich and take advantage so much. But you need to be a role model!</p>
<p><strong><em>What about sustainability? Last time we met, you said you’re working on </em><em>your collection to be sustainable. Were you always sustainable?</em></strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;re sustainable in like 70%, which is good as this is the first collection. I did my best, but I think we’ll improve with every collection. A couple percent more with each one. In my factory, I check myself what they do. It&#8217;s not sweat &amp; tears. That&#8217;s why the price is not cheap. It&#8217;s not unreachable though. If someone asks me why [something from Lalalove] is not 100 baht…the fabric is 400 baht, plus shipping to Bangkok, plus my work, plus pay for people sewing, plus I need to pay VAT. I can&#8217;t say that though…so, I just smile. I say that to myself. On the outside I am smiling, but I&#8217;m thinking &#8216;Just fuck off&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong><em>We found the older generation of Thais to be very traditional and </em><em>conservative so when we first saw your stuff, we thought ‘Wow, that&#8217;s </em><em>different!’ Where do you think the fashion industry in Thailand is at?</em></strong></p>
<p>I think Thailand can do very well. I think that Thailand is actually the best of South East Asia already. But the price point is&#8230; We are in the middle, which is such a shame. We are between H&amp;M &amp; Zara and Gucci &amp; Louis Vuitton.<br />
People see us because we are doing so much hard work, and they do think it’s good, yet they choose to buy H&amp;M. Or they choose to buy Zara. Let’s say in Zara the dress is about 3000 baht, the dress from a Thai designer is 8000 baht. But, if they are to spend 8000, they prefer to buy something from Paris, which is 16,000 baht. They appreciate the name, or the tag &#8216;made in Paris&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong><em>What has made you successful? What makes a good designer? Why do </em><em>you think you are at the point you are at now?</em></strong></p>
<p>I think because I have my positive attitude and I don’t give up. I keep going and try to find my happiness. I&#8217;m not going to do something that makes me unhappy, because I don’t just want a number in the bank. I can go on a cheap holiday! I don&#8217;t need to be in luxury all the time…just sometimes I need it, haha!</p>
<p><strong><em>How do you imagine LaLaLove’s future?</em></strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t need to be a too big of a company. I want to know everyone and be close to everyone in my brand. And talk, and drink and have dinner with everyone, who works with me. I want everyone to be happy.</p>

It&#8217;s something that bounds them together, that unique connection, making them share everything.</p>
<p>She says &#8216;sometimes the craziest moments makes for the best memories. Because after all, what is better than to do all the insane stuff with your best friends and laugh about them years and years after&#8230;&#8217;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>P&amp;P sits down with LCF&#8217;s second year womanswear student, Nuri Kim, to talk about her latest collection and her creative process.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tell us about yourself and what you do</em></strong><br />
I am currently studying my second year at LCF doing my BA in womenswear. I majored in Fine Art in Korea with a strong interest in colour combinations. My internship at Roksanda has had a large influence on this collection, especially the use of colour and the silhouettes. Inspired by Korean traditional clothing &#8216;Hanbok&#8217; and &#8216;Jogakbo&#8217; with the concept of &#8216;Dislocation&#8217;. I tried to reinterpret the Hanbok modernly with contrast between different layers of colour. I want to share my tradition through my own aesthetics.</p>
<p><strong><em>Where does your artistic influence come from and when did you know you wanted to be in this industry?</em></strong><br />
My artistic influence is quite flexible as I&#8217;m inspired by everything around me. From simple things such as people walking down the street, a poem and even a certain colour of paint I see in the store.<br />
I&#8217;ve had love of fashion from kindergarten, I&#8217;d refuse to go in if I didn&#8217;t like the outfit I wore that day.</p>
<p><strong><em>Describe your creative process.</em></strong><br />
I usually start a project with a single image and find a key word that best describes that image. Then I start researching deeply and come up with initial ideas and a direction. I will then sketch something and if I&#8217;m satisfied with it, do a 3D experiment.</p>
<p><strong><em>Whose work do you admire the most?</em></strong><br />
It will definitely have to be Alessandro Michele, designer for Gucci. I love his use of colour and artistic sensitivity. I am also fascinated by Jacquemus and his excessive use of silhouettes.</p>
<p><strong><em>Describe your fashion and style.</em></strong><br />
I usually dress in achromatic-coloured clothes with a small colour point. I like things minimal and I usually wear a long length skirt with earrings. I&#8217;d like to say my style has minimalist aesthetics blended with contemporary and timeless qualities that focus on details.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LCF graduate, <a href="http://showtime.arts.ac.uk/phedrejcalvados">Phedre Calvados</a>&#8216; first footwear collection derives from the strict education she received. The iconic bed of nails structure is the starting point to this project and serves as a strong story-telling anchor. She used it&#8217;s powerful and dramatic look to highlight the parallel between the experience of pain and the idea of pain. What our mind visually assimilates as painful is explored through the use of optical illusions, but suggesting a manipulated body posture as well as potentially torturous objects.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artist and freelance journalist, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/claudioparentela62/">Claudio Parentela </a>tells P&amp;P about his influences, his art and creative process.</p>
<blockquote><p>I plan absolutely anything, first of all, I need good music. I listen to everything and that&#8217;s when the magic happens, everything a wonderful new adventure begins. I don&#8217;t know what will happen, but every time, punctually, the magic begins and I can&#8217;t stop it nor want it to. The shapes, colours, lines and knots all intersect each other, everything finds it&#8217;s place and everything goes in its place, everything goes in another place and each image blends itself with the next one. Every image quarrels and loves with the previous one and every image loosens the knots of the next. All the images dance, play, cancel and merge themselves into a single image.</p>
<p>I love to combine photography and collage together.</p>
<p>First of all, for a creative natural need, a natural evolution of my being and artistic feeling, a crazy and huge love for the photography, my love for the white and the black, my passion for the black ink, the need to constantly to experiment in a free, crazy anarchic way. My will to be always free, myself and the continuous to mingle myself and to mix styles, ideas, things, people environments, books, magazines, fashion, comics. All used in a single gesture, in a single chaotic confused idea, the follow incessantly the flow of my images without restraint, always overcoming my limits and the limits of the medium, of the mediums, always merging all, always tainting all, pasting and cutting scenes, photos, collages, colours. I empty and I fill my mind continually, I continually multiply and I increase my seen countless of times with 1000 new and different eyes.</p>
<p>My muses and my inspirations are so many like Diamanda Galas, Ghedaliah Tazartes, Can, Sarah Vaughan and Nina Simone, Suicide &amp; Alan Vega, Aurobindo and the Mother, my beloved tarots, Kundalini Yoga and Qi Gong, Miss Carolyne, Sai Baba, Krishnamurti, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Virginia Woolf, Unica Zurn, Franz Kafka, Cesare Pavese, Derek Jarman, Vivienne Westwood and John Galliano and Moschini and Miles Davis and Ornette Colemann and Shirley Horn, Mickey Mouse and Asterix and the Sex Pistols, I like the Renaissance painters, the Byzantine icons and the Sacred art and Andy Warhol, Patty Waters and Joni Mitchell, Genesis P. Orridge &amp; Thee Majesty, Coil, Merzbow, Masonna, Terry Callier, The Incapacitans, Frank Zappa, Boyd Rice, Can, Swans, Suicide, Patty Waters, NOT, Lydia Lunch, Pablo Picasso, Pablo Picasso and Pablo Picasso, oh I love him so much, Tom Van Der Borght, Alexander McQueen, Marc Jacobs, Alexander Wang, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Karl Lagerfeld, many underground comics, my books, many many zines, magazines, my cats, the flowers in my garden, my travels, people, my friends, the laughters, so much much more again&#8230;</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Freelance beauty photographer, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/joweatherleyphotography/">Josephine Weatherley,</a> talks to us about her influences and creative process.</p>
<h5><em>Tell us about yourself and what you do?</em></h5>
<p>My name is <a href="http://joweatherley.com">Josephine</a>, I am 26 and a freelance photographer. I tend to describe myself as a photographer of beauty as I think it’s easy to find something wonderful to look at regardless of what it is: fashion, beauty, product, fine art, portraiture…all of these things have amazing elements in them which I love to explore. I love photography, literature and technology &#8211; my dream is to create my own magazine that combines all these, I feel technology and science are very under-represented in a lot of women’s editorial magazines and I would like to change that.</p>
<div class=""></div>
<h5><em>Where does your artistic influence come from?</em></h5>
<div class=""></div>
<div class="">My artistic influences come from detail and structure, and the constant differences presented within these things. I was very fortunate to have parents who encouraged me artistically and exposed me to a lot of different creatives works and artists like Richard Avedon, Cecil Beaton and Robert Capa. I was a very weird person growing up and often found it a struggle to express myself, the only way I found I could free myself was through taking photographs and illustrating ideas I had in my mind, I thought it would make people understand me better but eventually it became something that was much bigger than therapy for myself &#8211; it became something that has helped shape and define me as a person, allowing me to create works of art that make my heart beat fast with happiness and making it easier to keep a passion for life. I am very unsure of my place in the world and photography gives me a purpose!</div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""></div>

<h5></h5>
<div class="">
<h5><em>What themes do you explore in your work and why?</em></h5>
<div class=""></div>
<div class="">I really enjoy photographing women as I think there is such beauty in the female form, so I like to explore how I can really bring them to life through photography and draw someones attention to how I’m currently seeing something. I adore the details in a persons face as everybodies genetic makeup is so diverse and different. When I photograph fashion I like to explore colour, shape and textures as these are very important to me when creating a successful image but when I shoot a more art based project I tend to focus on the isolation of a particular object, which I help bring forth with macro lenses and use the powerful zoom quality to show you what you may have overlooked moments ago, and maybe try and fool people into thinking they are seeing something completely different&#8230;</div>
<div class=""></div>
<h5><em>Describe your creative process.</em></h5>
<div class=""></div>
<div class="">My creative process involves a lot of listening to music &#8211; the point being to block out any other influences apart from what’s going on in my head (music is unbelievably important to me, my boyfriend James has really shown me that it&#8217;s an amazing tool for creative output and channeling my emotions when I’m struggling to be expressive). I then sketch ideas out or write in a notebook to try and visualise what it is I want to achieve. I use Pintrest a lot too as it’s a great place to look at something that&#8217;s a little more physically visual and to gain inspiration from others. I then chat with potential team members and see how we can put something in to practice, it’s incredibly important to get an outsiders perspective as they can help cement an idea or suggest something that might be even stronger &#8211; therefore creating an even better body of work.</div>
<div class=""></div>
<h5>Gold Beauty</h5>
<div class=""></div>
<div class="">I have worked with Jess on several projects and I have never met anyone who is so fantastic at turning ideas into reality, she always knows what to do even if I don’t explain it properly! This beauty design was something Jess had wanted to do for a while, it was very different from my usual shoots but I had complete faith in her that she would turn it out and that we would get something stunning and meaningful out of it. We had worked with Emily previously and we knew she was perfect for what we wanted as she is so beautiful and very relaxed when it comes to letting us try new things (she did us proud with 4 hours in makeup and more glitter than we could clean up).</div>

<h5>Natura</h5>
<div class=""></div>
<div class="">This project was an amazing achievement from a concept that both myself, the designer and makeup artist came up with together: based around nature, flowers and insects. When I shot the 3 looks I wanted to convey a sense of otherworldliness without being too over the top whilst demonstrating the combined colours, textures and vividness of the overall looks. It was a challenging project but we got some amazing results and I was able to work with a whole new team of talented ladies.</div>
