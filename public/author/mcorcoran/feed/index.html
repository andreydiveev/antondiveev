				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Open now at the <a href="http://www.fashionspacegallery.com/">Fashion Space Gallery</a> is Don’t Stop Now: Fashion Photography Next, Part 1. Here&#8217;s what P&amp;P discovered at the newly opened exhibition&#8230;</em></p>
<p>“Don’t Stop Now!” is a rallying cry for fashion photographers everywhere. The message runs 5 feet high in cobalt blue along the wall opposite the gallery entrance. It’s the perfect sentiment to accompany a visitor as she dives into a fun exhibition that’s pretty damn serious about fashion photography.</p>
<p>Hailing from Foam in Amsterdam, this first part of a celebrated exhibition (the second part comes in March) looks with energy and optimism to the future of fashion photography, providing glimpses of its place within image history, and playfully asserting the identity of the medium. That identity is concerned with the wider meaning of photography in a digital world saturated with imagery, in a way that is fun, uncanny and full of variety.</p>
<p>Although there’s a lot of delicious colour to grab the attention when you first enter the show, I’d like to lead you in with one small image which said a lot.</p>
<p>Laetitia N<span style="color: #545454">è</span>gre’s Polaroid of Daiane Conterato is presumably a test shot from the shoot she did for Zoo Magazine in 2010. As such it figures ‘waste’ imagery – something besides the point. But this status is fetchingly reversed once the viewer engages with it in a gallery. This photo object becomes precious; a one of a kind, something small and delicate, which requires the viewer to lean in and regard it intimately. By its very nature, the photograph raises some big questions about the value of images in an age of massive reproduction and overwhelming digitisation. What can one, small image mean when our sights are flooded with so many every day?</p>
<div id="attachment_8119" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a ref="magnificPopup" href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/01/DontStopNow_Installation45.jpg"><img class="wp-image-8119 size-large" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/01/DontStopNow_Installation45-470x573.jpg" alt="Polaroids by Laetitia Nègre.

Photo: Katy Davies.</p></div>
<p>Daiane is pictured wearing a white veil which surrounds her whole head, four folds taper across its surface, and a black bow sits on her crown. Behind the bridal garment, the viewer can just make out the model’s face; softened and made vague by the translucent fabric. It’s an accessory that conjures up both revelation and concealment: Its surface both draws us into the face, and promises further exposure, and also obscures the features of that face. The image is innocent &#8211; keeping the secret of Daiane’s face, but also full of knowing &#8211; pinning her features into a fixed layer of exposed chemicals.</p>
<p>This to me, became the question of the exhibition: What does the surface of the photograph hide and what does it show? And can the image break beyond that 2D layer of pixels or chemicals?</p>
<p>An amber plastic curtain separates the two themes of ‘Materiality’ and ‘Play’, asking the visitor to move through a vivid, film-y layer which also provokes thoughts of surface. Once I had passed through, I found Hanna Putz&#8217;s untitled images which call your eye to run gracefully across supple, living forms: tendons in the hands and neck, the ripple of long hair, the sleek body of a greyhound. Again, faces were hidden so that exposure was juxtaposed with the unknown and unseen.</p>
<div id="attachment_8105" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a ref="magnificPopup" href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/01/Hanna-Putz-1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-8105 size-full" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/01/Hanna-Putz-1.jpg" alt="Hanna Putz, Untitled (LL 1), 2011 for New York Magazine.

<p>Playing even further with surface, the neighbouring images by Charlie Engman make a break beyond the 2D world of the photograph as colourful props leap out to sit on and under the images. This sculpture by photography feels like the natural continuation to his images which match up colours and lines to create optical illusions that play with space.</p>
<div id="attachment_8117" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a ref="magnificPopup" href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/01/DontStopNow_Installation12.jpg"><img class="wp-image-8117 size-large" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/01/DontStopNow_Installation12-470x313.jpg" alt="Photo: Katy Davies" width="470" height="313" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/01/DontStopNow_Installation12-470x313.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/01/DontStopNow_Installation12-310x206.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/01/DontStopNow_Installation12-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/01/DontStopNow_Installation12.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Work by Charlie Engman. Photo: Katy Davies</p></div>
<p>Back in the &#8216;Materiality&#8217; section, I discovered more meddling with the surface of the image: Jonathan Hallam&#8217;s &#8220;Abstraction de Sensation&#8221; saw reflection and projection create a butterfly like image, a layer which disguised a model with painted lips. And Daniel Sannwald&#8217;s untitled image from 2008 for <em>Dazed and Confused </em>saw another intervention onto the surface of the skin &#8211; bright face paint like makeup drawn across the models&#8217; faces. By contrast, his 2012 image for <em>Arena Homme + </em>is digitally disturbed, shards of pixels dragging at the sleeve of jumper. The distorted red fabric is also affected by black, geometric embellishments, so that photographer and designer work together to build a motif for the garment.</p>
<p>These are photographs that push at their own boundaries, launching forward and twisting under the eye. They ask the viewer to consider where the object of the photograph ends and experience begins. There were many more images which posed interesting questions of the medium of fashion photography, but to discover those you&#8217;ll have to take a trip to 20 John Princes Street yourself.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On 4th of December I left behind a cold, dark London evening, to enter a beautiful world created by LCF’s latest cohort of talented <a href="http://www.arts.ac.uk/fashion/courses/graduate-school/culture-and-curation/ma-costume-design-for-performance/">MA Costume Design for Performance students</a>. Their final year show at Sadler’s Wells enchanted an audience of press, artists and industry with a diversity of styles and stories, all of which revealed how compelling the art of costumery can be. Watching these creations realised on stage, was like stepping into a dream world where myth and memory were interwoven, and the bounds of reality were altered to the same extent that the garments were folded, expanded and transformed.</p>
<p>As a relative innocent to the possibilities of costume I was unsure of what to expect from the show. However, early on, an overriding and intriguing theme became clear: each of these costumes sought out transformation. Whether touching upon political stories or childhood fairy tales, each costume proved to be a series of artworks which were continually created by the movements of the performer. Xiao Yufan’s ‘The Snow Queen’, performed by Lorraine Smith heightened this sense of transformation as it saw the young boy Kay become entranced with a pyramid shaped snowflake to then become the Snow Queen herself – frozen and shivering in a rigid cape of cracking ice. The movement from boy to woman, from frozen to melting, showed the potential for costume and performer to come together in a bodily realisation of emotional drama.</p>
<div id="attachment_7573" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a ref="magnificPopup" href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/12/snowqueen.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7573 size-large" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/12/snowqueen-470x470.jpg" alt="The Snow Queen by Xiao Yufan" width="470" height="470" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/12/snowqueen-470x470.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/12/snowqueen-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/12/snowqueen-310x310.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/12/snowqueen-300x300.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/12/snowqueen.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Snow Queen by Xiao Yufan</p></div>
<p>The costumes were tantalisingly ephemeral as dramatic moments were created and dismantled. Daphne Karstens’ interpretation of Beckett’s <em>Ping</em> saw the physical body become the spiritual body which, as she explains, “might only exist for the briefest of moments”. A stiff shroud covered in twisted wire was shed by the performer, who was again Lorraine Smith, representing a release from the physical body. She emerged, flexing and graceful in a new white ‘spirit’ body from which clouds of smoke began to flow. This felt so unexpected and magical that the audience gasped.</p>
<div id="attachment_7569" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a ref="magnificPopup" href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/12/ping.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7569 size-large" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/12/ping-470x470.jpg" alt="Ping by Daphne Karstens" width="470" height="470" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/12/ping-470x470.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/12/ping-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/12/ping-310x310.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/12/ping-300x300.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/12/ping.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ping by Daphne Karstens</p></div>
<p>These costumes go to show how important collaboration is in theatre and the arts. The names in the performance booklet that I held in my hands were not just the costumiers’ but also the performers, and each MA graduate had taken on multiple roles to bring to life their pieces; as designers and directors and technicians. Sound and lighting played such an essential part of each piece. A soundtrack of rainfall accompanied Alexandra Kapsala’s ‘Medea’ bringing an atmosphere of sorrow and loss even as the mythical woman’s costume grew red and bloated with rage. Equally as effective, Pallavi Patel’s young boy at play was covered in a suit of fine wooden pieces which clacked and clattered like a toy puppet or child’s building blocks as he danced.</p>
<p>My favourite piece was another reworking of a myth which called upon the power of light. Clare McGarrigle’s &#8216;Narcissus&#8217;, performed by Francesco Mangiacasale, saw the young man who falls in love with his own reflection dressed in a mirrored cape, which in turn became wings, and then became the lake into which he gazes at his own image. Streaks of light danced off this garment, surrounding the character in a moving, flashing halo of his own movement. Reflection rebounded as Narcissus gazed at his own image projected onto a screen, over which his shadow fell &#8211; a dark copy of the man made by light. Clare’s costume called upon the whole space of the stage to create this image of the myth; a dream vision which stunned the audience.</p>
<div id="attachment_7568" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a ref="magnificPopup" href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/12/Narcissus.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7568 size-large" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/12/Narcissus-470x470.jpg" alt="Narcissus by Clare McGarrigle" width="470" height="470" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/12/Narcissus-470x470.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/12/Narcissus-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/12/Narcissus-310x310.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/12/Narcissus-300x300.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2014/12/Narcissus.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Narcissus by Clare McGarrigle</p></div>
<p>What became clear was that not only did each costume undergo metamorphosis, but that any one performance would transform the costume in a different way &#8211; dependant on the performer, the technicians, the mood in the room. These are not lifeless garments, but objects to be realised in movement, and thereafter never to be the same again. If you can never step in the same river twice, then neither can you see the same costume performance twice. Afterwards, I stepped back out into the December night, my own vision of the role of costume transformed by the glowing, shifting shapes that had passed on stage.</p>
