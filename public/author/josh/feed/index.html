				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fashion and the female body to many have been as natural a pairing as Karl Lagerfeld and Chanel or Levi Roots and barbeque sauce but the recent scandal that has erupted around controversial photographer Terry Richardson has added a fresh perspective to fashion&#8217;s fascination with the female body. This is why you should check out <em>Posturing: Photographing the Body in Fashion </em>before it closes in London on 12 November.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18147" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/11/Posturing_06.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/11/Posturing_06.jpg 1000w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/11/Posturing_06-500x334.jpg 500w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/11/Posturing_06-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/11/Posturing_06-750x500.jpg 750w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/11/Posturing_06-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The female body is the blueprint for everything from the designer envisioning the collection to sexualised and depicted glamour shoots you see spread across billboards and fashion magazines. A group of photographers have and come together challenge this notion and explore the role of the female body in contemporary fashion photography. Exhibition curators Holly Hay, Art Buyer at Dazed Media Studio, and Shonagh Marshall, curator of numerous Somerset House exhibitions, have linked up with luxury online retailer THE OUTNET.COM on a three-part tour of the exhibition that started in London.</p>
<div id="attachment_18148" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-18148" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/11/BriannaCapozzi.jpeg" alt="Photograph by Brianna Capozzi, ‘Laura Ashley’ from Double Magazine, Autumn/Winter 2016." width="1000" height="1504" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/11/BriannaCapozzi.jpeg 1000w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/11/BriannaCapozzi-332x500.jpeg 332w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/11/BriannaCapozzi-768x1155.jpeg 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/11/BriannaCapozzi-499x750.jpeg 499w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/11/BriannaCapozzi-600x902.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Photograph by Brianna Capozzi, ‘Laura Ashley’ from Double Magazine, Autumn/Winter 2016.</p></div>
<p>Images were collated from 2010 until now from celebrated photographers such as Charlie Engman, Johnny Dufort, Marton Perlaki, LCF alumna Coco Capitan and Zoe Ghertner amongst others will be on display alongside seminal. The exhibition uses the images to chart a movement in which the body is captured in extraordinary gestures and poses, tracing a new aesthetic in fashion photography over seven years ago and continues to develop today.</p>

<p>If the industry wants to move forward from the depiction of the female body, it needs to look at the female body through a different lens, which is exactly what this exhibition sets out to intend. So head down before it closes next Sunday 12 November, otherwise, you&#8217;ll have to catch it in December with a film, shown at Art Basel in Miami Beach, and will conclude with a book, <em>Posturing: Writing the Body</em> i<em>n Fashion</em> released in March next year.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Posturing: Photographing the Body in Fashion is on at 10, Thurloe Place, SW7, from November 2nd to November 12th</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1981, a young Anita Corbin took 28 double portraits of young women from different cultural groups. She documented skins, mods, punks, rockabillies, new romantics, rastas and young lesbians at the beginning of her career. She was fascinated by the ways in which cultural allegiance and identity were boldly and explicitly expressed through fashion, music and environment by women emerging from adolescence. Anita was recently commissioned to take these images around the country for her travelling exhibition, <a href="http://visiblegirls.com/">Visible Girls: Revisited</a>.</span></p>

<p class="p1">The exhibition brings together original images of women from different subcultures of the early 1980s and newly commissioned portraits of the same women now. Her work reveals and reflects upon identity and society at various stages of women&#8217;s lives. The images act as <span class="s1">a rarity for the time, not only because of their subjects but because of the photographer&#8217;s technical approach using slow colour film and portable flash.</span></p>
<h1 class="p1" style="text-align: center"><a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/visible-girls-revisited-exhibition-and-uk-tour-film-photography#/">Want to support the exhibition? Find out how to fund the tour.</a></h1>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anita spoke about her work and exhibition recently. She said, &#8220;This exhibition is not only about the powerful bond between women united by subculture, belief and friendship, but about the potential of women coming together across generations. <em>Visible Girls: Revisited</em>, allows the ‘visibility’ of youth to shine a light on the often-disregarded wisdom of the older woman, revealing a unique, cross-generational tribe with the power to provoke and inspire. <em>Visible Girls: Revisited</em> is an exhibition where mothers and daughters will find mutually provocative ground through which to forge a rare solidarity &#8211; that at this point in our history we need more than ever.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1">Last year Corbin launched an international social media campaign in order to track the women down. Now, 36 years later and with over 70% of the women found, the original images of those young women will be displayed alongside a new series &#8211; of the women they became.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The 56 women who feature in the images were mainly from London but some were on a day trip or on holiday in the city when Corbin photographed them, many are now living in Europe or further afield. The exhibition will tour England &#8211; each location will have a unique presentation inspired by the voice of the city.</span><span class="s4"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">The exhibition explores the<span class="s1"> individual stories behind each image, seeing how the women&#8217;s lives have changed since the original shot was taken. What has happened in those 36 years? Have their lives developed as they imagined? How have changes in society and its attitudes to women affected them?</span></p>

<p class="p1">Do you know any of these Visible Girls? The search continues for the remaining 30% of the missing subjects &#8211; join us on social media and help us find them <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=visiblegirls&amp;src=typd"><span class="s3">#VisibleGirls</span></a>.<span class="s1">  </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UK nightclubs and its music scene are in the midst of a transitional period, some argue the scene is dying and the authorities are actively hacking away at one of our most successful exports, others say we are embarking on a creative awakening, what&#8217;s certain is that everything is changing.</p>
<p>We took this opportunity to talk to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/waxwingsofficial?ref=br_tf">Wax Wings</a> to hear his views on the scene, and his rise from the capital&#8217;s underground gay dance scene to touring with Maya Jane Cole and performing at London&#8217;s newest mega-venue Printworks this month.</p>
<div id="attachment_16298" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-16298" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli.jpeg" alt="Processed with VSCO with a6 preset" width="1000" height="670" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli.jpeg 1000w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-500x335.jpeg 500w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-768x515.jpeg 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-750x503.jpeg 750w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-600x402.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Processed with VSCO with a6 preset</p></div>
<p>Wax Wings, or Joseph Icaro, depending on how well you know him, is an artist in the truest sense. Familiar with the small Gothic town of Whitby in Yorkshire? Nope, us neither. But it&#8217;s where Wax was born to his dad, a Brazilian musician originally from Bahia, and his mother, a British artist. He moved to London to study Fine Art at UAL&#8217;s Camberwell, and it was there that he realised creating music was what he wanted to do. He also did some modelling for LCF Design friends and reckons he might be in a previous Pigeons &amp; Peacocks issue.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-16299 aligncenter" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/13600071_605174442975385_4124759036144273255_n.jpg" alt="13600071_605174442975385_4124759036144273255_n" width="768" height="960" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/13600071_605174442975385_4124759036144273255_n.jpg 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/13600071_605174442975385_4124759036144273255_n-400x500.jpg 400w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/13600071_605174442975385_4124759036144273255_n-600x750.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p>So where does the name Wax Wings come from we ask? This wasn&#8217;t always the name he worked under (&#8220;let&#8217;s not go into that&#8221;, he says). He use to work under a different name, one shared by another artist, whose been on Radio 1 several times. He explained that his friends kept on raving about hearing him on radio, and he had to keep on saying that wasn&#8217;t him. He needed something new, so he decided to use his last name Icaro &#8211; which means Icarus, who is the famous son from Greek mythology that travels to the sun. Basically, Icarus flew too close to the sun with the wings his father constructed from feathers and wax, which melted, plummeting Icarus to his death in the sea below. So wings of wax – that’s where the name derived from.</p>
<div id="attachment_16300" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-16300 size-full" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-3.jpeg" alt="for-the-below-credit-alexandre-paganelli-3" width="1000" height="669" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-3.jpeg 1000w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-3-500x335.jpeg 500w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-3-768x514.jpeg 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-3-750x502.jpeg 750w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-3-600x401.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Alexandre Paganelli.</p></div>
<p>Wax was already involved in music before moving down south. &#8220;Well, I started DJ&#8217;ing in my hometown – in a really shit pub. There wasn’t really a scene for it in the town I grew up in so I kind of moved it over to Leeds. I sort of dipped my toes in the hard dance scene there. There’s a really good music scene in Leeds at the moment. But the music didn’t really start until I moved down to London in 2011. I got wrapped up in the gay music scene in London with Larry Tee and some of the influential characters from the 80s in New York&#8221;, he explains.</p>
<p>Wrapped up in the scene, what do you mean? &#8220;I came to London like everyone else trying to find themselves. I was dressing crazy and got lured into those kinds of parties. Larry gave me a chance, we then started playing with each other. We sort of bounced off each other which was really fun&#8221;, he tells us. Do you still play together? He says no, &#8220;He’s now moved to Berlin though so we don’t see each other that much anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F269190614&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=1500&#038;maxheight=1000"></iframe></p>
<p>Larry and Wax played the underground gay scene together for a while, before playing more and more gigs independently. He met his music manager at one of his first club gigs &#8211; originally he thought it was the most unlikely place to meet his music manager Steven. But he says, &#8220;Knowing him now, it couldn&#8217;t have happened any other way.&#8221; That&#8217;s how Wax joined the Weird &amp; Wonderful family, which includes industry giants like Justin Martin, Catz &#8216;N&#8217; Dogz and Maya Jane Coles. Past clients also include Italian duo Tale of Us, and Magda just to name a few.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything is amazing! Absolutely all of it. I think I got very lucky with this gig&#8221;, he says on the label. Wax then dropped his EP, which got a lot of support from some of the industries biggest artists like Leftfield and George Fitzgerald. We asked him how that made him feel? &#8220;It’s amazing to open up your promo report and to see these amazing people you went to see at gigs or shows supporting your music. Seeing these big names understanding what I’m trying to do and create is just amazing. Such a great feeling! It’s really humbling which is always good.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F298458817&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=1500&#038;maxheight=1000"></iframe></p>
<p>We ask if he wants to achieve the same fame and status as Leftfield and George Fitzgerald. He said, &#8220;I don’t want to pigeons and peacock hole myself ha. I want to be really open! I want to do a lot of different things – there’s a lot more to show than being a headline DJ.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wax is a humble guy, he says he gets that from his parents, but it&#8217;s refreshing to hear an emerging artist not wanting to headline Lovebox or clubs in Ibiza.</p>
<p>So what does he want? A record label? International fame? A residency at fabric or Berghain? Yeah of course! But he also wants to move to Japan. Look at any of Wax&#8217;s social media accounts and you&#8217;ll notice three flags. One British and Brazilian, flags that represent his heritage, and a Japanese one, a country he says he&#8217;s adopted.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16301" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/13641183_609357069223789_2520909567707245995_o-e1486391393965.jpg" alt="13641183_609357069223789_2520909567707245995_o" width="1000" height="1248" /></p>
<p>He&#8217;s been to Japan a few times, most recently touring with Maya Jane Coles. How was the trip, we ask. &#8220;<span class="TextRun SCX263453644" lang="EN-US"><span class="NormalTextRun SCX263453644">Oh don’t get me started on Japan. You will not shut me up! It’s the best place in the world. It has the best food and people, everything about it is perfect. I was out there for three weeks touring. We played at Circus in Tokyo and then we went down to Osaka and played Circus again, which definitely won out of both venues. Osaka was incredible! It was absolutely amazing. I’ve been to Japan twice but never made it to Womb, but hopefully in the next trip in April we want to swarm in.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p><span class="TextRun SCX263453644" lang="EN-US"><span class="NormalTextRun SCX263453644">What was the best part? He says, &#8220;<span class="TextRun SCX232945953" lang="EN-US"><span class="NormalTextRun SCX232945953">You think you’d want to go into the cities while in Japan, but I’m super obsessed with their culture so I like to going out and seeing </span></span><span class="TextRun SCX232945953" lang="EN-US"><span class="NormalTextRun SCX232945953">real Japan</span></span> <span class="TextRun SCX232945953" lang="EN-US"><span class="NormalTextRun SCX232945953">in the countryside, temples, and </span></span><span class="TextRun SCX232945953" lang="EN-US"><span class="NormalTextRun SCX232945953">Kyoto was amazing.&#8221; </span></span> </span></span></p>

<p>He&#8217;s also obsessed with Japanese fashion and people. During one of his visits, he played a gay party in Tokyo called <em>Fancy Him.</em> Wax believes in London, well sometimes, fashion is used powerfully to say &#8216;look at me&#8217; and this is what I&#8217;m about, but the substance behind that look doesn&#8217;t always translate. In Tokyo, it&#8217;s very different. &#8220;Everyone just seems effortlessly cool in Japan&#8221; and they act normal instead of trying to say something.</p>
<p>We start discussing musicians creating their own clothing lines and taking creative control of every aspect of their careers. So where do you stand with clothing lines for your record label? &#8220;If it looks good then why not, I&#8217;m 100% behind that! I mean artists creating t-shirts is one thing, I&#8217;m not sure if you can call that fashion, but if you do it right – offer something with usual cuts and patterns, not just  a record label emblem. If you&#8217;re going to do it and label yourself as fashion, then be fashion, not merchandise.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_16302" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-16302 size-full" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-2.jpeg" alt="Processed with VSCO with a6 preset" width="1000" height="670" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-2.jpeg 1000w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-2-500x335.jpeg 500w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-2-768x515.jpeg 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-2-750x503.jpeg 750w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2017/02/For-the-below-credit-Alexandre-Paganelli-2-600x402.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Alexandre Paganelli.</p></div>
<p>And he&#8217;s right. The industry is changing, people are now streaming or illegally downloading instead of buying records and albums. Creating a clothing line is an obvious way to generate economic growth &#8211; but don&#8217;t just print overpriced merchandise and label it a brand. We then start discussing how the DJ experience needs to evolve alongside the industry.</p>
<p>Wax believes the experience can be heightened. &#8220;I think we can be playing more than just records after records. I think there should an element of performance in there to keep it fresh. When you go to Secret Garden Party, there was stage performances and visuals to go with every set, I think the scene needs more of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>So how do you do that we ask? &#8220;I played at Egg London once and brought my friend down to create BfX visuals for the night. I think there needs to be more little things like that improve the live experience. You can expand your horizons, it&#8217;s a stage, you should be offering more on the stage than records. I guess I&#8217;m thinking this because my album is so different to the club stuff, it&#8217;s more of a live experience. I saw Massive Attack last year, they expressed their political stance and more emotion than just listening to songs through their show.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F294564783&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=1500&#038;maxheight=1000"></iframe></p>
<p>Politics has been on the tip of most people&#8217;s tongue the last year. We&#8217;ve had a supercharged year that saw a rise of nationalism through Trump and Brexit alongside the western world&#8217;s first Muslim major city mayor in Sadiq Khan. We wanted to know where Wax stood politically?</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s (politics) been shaken up. I wasn&#8217;t that bothered before but now I feel more engaged. There&#8217;s been a lot of things that have hit more close to home as a person, artist, gay guy, and my moral values – I guess it&#8217;s ruffled my feathers. It&#8217;s shaken me up a little as a gay mixed-race guy, that&#8217;s two minorities that feel under attack. It feels a bit close to home! I feel like I need to use my voice and music to say something now.&#8221;</p>
<p>His new album, Umbilical, is very different to his previous material. He says it&#8217;s more mysterious and dark, instead of having a club feel, it&#8217;s more of a live album. His music spans across genres, from trip-hop to techno, and breakbeat to house, so we&#8217;re expecting something very unique. DJ Mag also draw many similarities between his productions and the work of Aphex Twin, Massive Attack and Tricky &#8211; naturally, we&#8217;re excited to hear the new material.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BP8NUWVAVQo/">https://www.instagram.com/p/BP8NUWVAVQo/</a></p>
<p>We finish off by discussing where dance music and clubbing culture is today, especially for spectators. Everyone knows that nightlife is taking a pounding at the moment in the UK. Cultural institutions and club environments where new ideas begin and where people met are closing in almost every town and city. There was some light at the end of 2016 for London when fabric reopened and news of Printworks surfaced, we ask him if we&#8217;re going through a crisis or creative awakening?</p>
<p>&#8220;I think both. It’s incredible to see what happens when a community comes together like dance music did for Fabric. But you can also see what happens when a community falls apart at the same time. Because things start getting neglected and it allows for Fabric and other places to close. It just makes me excited that I might actually get to play there one day, it’s no longer off the cards yet&#8221;, he tells us.</p>
<p>Wax Wings is performing at Printworks on <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/event.aspx?911133">18 February alongside Maya Jane Coles and Alan Fitzpatrick</a>. He will also be hosting three dates at Dalston Superstore this year.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robert Mapplethorpe spent his whole career trying to be Robert Mapplethorpe, an idealised artist bathed in fame, money and ruthless ambition. The controversial photographer spent his life working towards international recognition and distanced himself from friends, family and lovers who might have toppled his status or artistic vision. Perhaps his biggest headline as an artist came after he died of AIDs in 1989, when Texan Republican Dick Armey labelled his work as “morally reprehensible trash” and caused uproar across America that refuelled the debate about restricting the freedom of artists to pursue their own goals. Look at the Pictures, the new Mapplethorpe biopic, takes you on an enticing journey through his artistic mind, while cementing his place on the photography world wall of fame, a moment which might have finally satisfied him as an artist if he was still alive.</p>

<p>Look at the Pictures depicts Mapplethorpe’s early years as a Catholic schoolboy growing up in straight-laced suburbia Queens to his extremely graphic photographs of Manhattan’s homosexual underworld, while reminiscing on a psychedelic romance with musician Patti Smith. Although his work isn’t too everyone’s taste, his life was never dull, and this stunning documentary takes you through each chapter of Mapplethorpe’s biography from headline news to intimate personal moments. His photography signature was shooting in black and white, while his defining style was provocative images of penises and flowers, which learnt him the nickname, ‘flower-petal-and-penis’. As the title suggests, the documentary looks over hundreds of Mapplethorpe’s images which were lent from Los Angeles Getty and LACMA museums to provide backdrop into his life. Directors Randy Barbato and Fenton Bailey, known for RuPaul’s Drag Race and Inside Deep Throat, were commissioned by HBO to produce Look at the Pictures about the iconic artist that still remains relevant over 25 years’ after passing away.</p>
<div id="attachment_13702" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-13702" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/04/mapplethorpe-look-at-the-pictures-dogwoof-documentary-8-copy.jpg" alt="Copyright credit: (C) Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation." width="1000" height="1032" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/04/mapplethorpe-look-at-the-pictures-dogwoof-documentary-8-copy.jpg 1000w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/04/mapplethorpe-look-at-the-pictures-dogwoof-documentary-8-copy-310x320.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/04/mapplethorpe-look-at-the-pictures-dogwoof-documentary-8-copy-768x793.jpg 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/04/mapplethorpe-look-at-the-pictures-dogwoof-documentary-8-copy-470x485.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/04/mapplethorpe-look-at-the-pictures-dogwoof-documentary-8-copy-300x310.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Copyright credit: (C) Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation.</p></div>
<p>The pair lived during New York&#8217;s gay 80s and were aware of Mapplethorpe, but only as the brand, name and obvious controversy. When asked why they wanted to be part of the film, Randy said, “We’re attracted to people who are overexposed and under revealed. Mapplethorpe really ticked that box.” They wanted to dig deep and portray the man and artist, instead of the name and controversy that surrounds Mapplethorpe. Through a collection of archive images, and narrative from his friends, family and colleagues, the directors have created an honest and beautiful biographical film into his life. Look at the Pictures also touches on social issues that haven’t vanished over a quarter of a century later.</p>
<div id="attachment_13705" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-13705" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/04/mapplethorpe.jpg" alt="Copyright credit: (C) Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation." width="1000" height="1014" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/04/mapplethorpe.jpg 1000w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/04/mapplethorpe-310x314.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/04/mapplethorpe-768x779.jpg 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/04/mapplethorpe-470x477.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/04/mapplethorpe-300x304.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Copyright credit: (C) Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation.</p></div>
<p>Writing this account as someone born after Mapplethorpe passed away, my knowledge of America’s unwarranted attitude to homosexuality, even in liberal places like New York, can only come from books and research. Look at the Pictures offers a fascinating perspective into homosexuality three decades ago and 1970- 80s New York, years before hipsters transformed Greenwich and the Lower East Side, at a time when Time Square was a backyard for crack slingers and prostitutes. In the film and trailer, Mapplethorpe says, “I always was fascinated by the idea of taking sexuality and bringing it to a level it hadn’t been to before”. This ultimately led to an infuriated Senator Jesse Helms addressing the House of Representatives, asking the government to stop funding this sort of photography. He also spoke openly about Mapplethorpe, “I don’t even acknowledge that the fellow who did this was an artist. I think he was a jerk”.</p>
<div id="attachment_13703" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-13703" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/04/mapplethorpe-look-at-the-pictures-dogwoof-documentary-5-copy.jpg" alt="Copyright credit: (C) Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation." width="1000" height="1167" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/04/mapplethorpe-look-at-the-pictures-dogwoof-documentary-5-copy.jpg 1000w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/04/mapplethorpe-look-at-the-pictures-dogwoof-documentary-5-copy-310x362.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/04/mapplethorpe-look-at-the-pictures-dogwoof-documentary-5-copy-768x896.jpg 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/04/mapplethorpe-look-at-the-pictures-dogwoof-documentary-5-copy-470x548.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/04/mapplethorpe-look-at-the-pictures-dogwoof-documentary-5-copy-300x350.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Copyright credit: (C) Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation.</p></div>
<p>The nation&#8217;s dislike of the extremely graphic photographer, especially in politics, resulted in 107 representatives voicing their oppositions against The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), a legalisation signed in 1965 by President Lyndon that said, “We fully recognise that no government can call artistic excellence into existence… Nor should any government seek to restrict the freedom of the artist to pursue his own goals in his own way.” The NEA had already come under scrutiny that decade after Ronald Reagan stepped into office in 1980, he tried to overturn the bill but had no support in congress. Mapplethorpe was part of an artistic collective used by politicians to justify censoring and rewriting the definition of art. He was also used as an excuse to put pressure on museums, Washington&#8217;s Corcoran Gallery of Art dropped his exhibition because of political and religious pressure, it also put the NEA in the spotlight and added fire to the art vs pornography argument that still exists today. Los Angeles-based artist Illma Gore recently evoked a response from American politicians for her <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/17/nude-donald-trump-painting-illma-gore-lawsuits?CMP=fb_gu">nude portrayal of Donald Trump</a>, which is now officially banned in the US. Look at the Pictures shows us Mapplethorpe&#8217;s legacy as an artist, individual and that his boundary breaking work has a significant place in the continues struggle that artists face trying to depict the world and social movements as it is with authenticity and elegantly.</p>
