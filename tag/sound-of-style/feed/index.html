				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Listen to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/parcelsmusic/">Parcels</a> and be transported back to the 70s. With their synths, funk influence and nostalgic melodies, Parcels are bringing disco back and we are loving it.</em></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-15749" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/thumbnail_PARCELS_01sqrwebByCai_Leplaw-Lowres-470x515.jpg" alt="thumbnail_PARCELS_01sqrwebByCai_Leplaw Lowres" width="470" height="515" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/thumbnail_PARCELS_01sqrwebByCai_Leplaw-Lowres-470x515.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/thumbnail_PARCELS_01sqrwebByCai_Leplaw-Lowres-310x340.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/thumbnail_PARCELS_01sqrwebByCai_Leplaw-Lowres-768x841.jpg 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/thumbnail_PARCELS_01sqrwebByCai_Leplaw-Lowres-300x329.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/thumbnail_PARCELS_01sqrwebByCai_Leplaw-Lowres.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>
<p><em>How did the band come together?</em></p>
<p>For years in Australia we all knew one another. We had played in a bunch of bands together since we were 13 or so. It naturally fell into this formation when we discovered The Funk, electronic music and production.</p>
<p><em>How would you describe your sound?</em></p>
<p>It’s a disco dance party on acid. Sometimes the trip makes you want to question yourself and everything else; sometimes you just want to get down.</p>
<p><em>Tell us about your new single</em> MyEnemy.</p>
<p>That groove came from Jules’s bedroom back in Australia! Nearly 2 years ago, he sent us the basis after a fuzzy all-nighter involving strippers, cocaine and motorbikes. It all came together in Berlin where we worked it into shape, wrote the vocal fronting and rerecorded it together.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7KSn-vAH3nA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><em>There is something so nostalgic and dreamy about your music – is that an important element of your work?</em></p>
<p>Yeah. The nostalgia comes from our influences and the classic feel. The dreaminess I guess stems from the self-production and electronic elements. Also our lyrics are never very clear – they make their point quite indirectly, dreamily.</p>
<p><em>How, as a band, did you arrive at this signature style?</em></p>
<p>We came from a wild array of backgrounds which gave us individual ideals. We then came together with a joint love for classic disco, funk, pop and nu electronic production and Parcels came out. But we&#8217;re ever-changing and still finding our pocket.</p>
<p><em>Who are your musical influences?</em></p>
<p>Chic, Bowie, Kraftwerk, Tribe, Dylan, Megadeth, Gorillaz, Chopin, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Beach Boys and Katy Perry.</p>
<p><em>You’re based in Berlin at the moment – has this affected your approach to music in any way?</em></p>
<p>Certainly. The electronic and techno scene inevitably hit us and we took on the driving feel immediately. We discovered Kraftwerk in all their subtle electro glory. And in winter, it’s too cold to leave the god damn flat, so we&#8217;re writing like crazy.</p>
<p><em>Berlin is such an amazing city – has it challenged or developed you creatively in any way?</em></p>
<p>It’s a super sweet city! We have at times also felt like it lacks the disco (in a live setting). But we&#8217;re gathering troops and launching an all out groove attack, starting with our secret dance parties.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-qHOAuQaBMA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><em>What do you think of the London music scene?</em></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve played two shows in London. Both were club shows with dark dance vibe. The crowds have been eager thus far – can’t wait to bring party there again! (<em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/949548008507398/">Parcels play Hoxton Square Bar and Kitchen 07/10/16!</a>)</em></p>
<p><em>You’re from Australia – how do European venues differ from Australian venues?</em></p>
<p>A venue is a venue is a venue. It’s all in the crowd! Two crowds are never the same – that’s what makes it exciting, trying to create and cultivate an energy in a new situation.  So far, Europeans have been super attentive and ready to party.</p>
<p><em>What’s your favourite thing about playing live?</em></p>
<p>Its the only 45 minutes of our lives in which we actually know what we&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p><em>What’s been your most memorable live performance so far and why?</em></p>
<p>A couple of weeks back, we threw a secret Berlin party. It was low-key, down a back alley in a little room with a couple of other bands and 100 of our friends getting absolutely sweaty on the disco floor. Lately every gig has been super exciting though!</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I0X3GpVOheM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><em>Are you working on an album?</em></p>
<p>We&#8217;re not prepared to talk album yet, but we have an EP on the way! Jan2017.</p>
<p><em>I love the 70s/slightly kitsch style of the band and it’s music – do you ever feel like you were born into the wrong generation?</em></p>
<p>Not really – we definitely idolise music of the past and recording in the 70s and 80s. But we also love what’s going on now in many ways, that’s where we find our blend and we wouldn’t rather be anywhere else!</p>
<p><em>What else we can we expect to see from you in the near future? </em></p>
<p>Better song writing, smoother production, a bolder live show, more visual exploration. We are so excited for loads of shows and more recording in 2017!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Leo Stannard is a dream in every way &#8211; beautiful face, beautiful voice, beautiful songs and all around nice guy.  We catch up with the singer-songwriter to talk about his upcoming album, his tour and his first song about his cat. </em></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-15609" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Leo-High-Res-470x678.jpg" alt="Leo Stannard" width="470" height="678" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Leo-High-Res-470x678.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Leo-High-Res-310x447.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Leo-High-Res-300x433.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Leo-High-Res.jpg 693w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>How would you describe your sound?</em></p>
<p>I suppose on first look I&#8217;m a singer-songwriter but I&#8217;m trying to take that to a whole new place. The raw song will always be the most important thing for me but I’m not scared to experiment in the production as well – a combination of the old and the new.</p>
<p><em>How did you get into song writing?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been writing songs since I was ten years old, so it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve always done. I don&#8217;t know how I got into it – I just always wanted to create stuff. The first song I wrote was about my cat, a classic.</p>
<p><em>What is your song writing process? Do you start with a melody and build up words around it, or do you start with the words and story and then write music to accompany it?</em></p>
<p>I normally get all the melodies in place first and then by that point, I&#8217;m subconsciously singing words with those melodies and that&#8217;s normally a sign of something good. Then I build a concept around that and if it works, I take into the studio. Having a creative structure really helps me.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xDs3Fj-4j9U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><em>Have you been working on an album?</em></p>
<p>I have! I&#8217;ve been working on it since I was 17. The album is the biggest thing for me so I&#8217;m going to make sure it&#8217;s perfect. It&#8217;s going to be a proper journey, not just a random collection of songs.</p>
<p><em>Is it hard to make an album? Did you struggle picking the final song list from all your material?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been planning this since the moment I started to write music so it&#8217;s been a long journey and obviously the song list has evolved massively. I’m writing new songs even now at this late stage of the record, which could feature.</p>
<p><em>You’ve been getting a lot of radio play now – what’s it like to hear yourself on the radio?</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s incredibly humbling. Simple as that. I’m very grateful for some music to be played anywhere.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mrt-UntgdTM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><em>Who are your musical heroes? Have they influenced your own music?</em></p>
<p>A hero for me is Neil Young. He’s definitely influenced me with his pure song writing. I’m constantly listening to Damien Rice, Kendrick Lamar, Claude Debussy, Melody Gardot, Robert Glasper, Snarky Puppy. I&#8217;m not sure if they directly influence the music I write though, I think their drive, fearlessness and creativity is what influences me.</p>
<p><em>London is renowned for its music scene. How has it inspired or developed you as a musician since you moved her?</em></p>
<p>I’m from a very small village near Leicester, and in Ragdale you&#8217;re very much in your own zone, so being in London opens you up to so many more things and that can be very inspiring. You get to mix with people who are in similar positions as you as well, which is great.</p>
<p><em>Where are your favourite music venues and regular haunts?</em></p>
<p>My favourite venue back in Leicester is The Cookie where I&#8217;m actually playing on my UK tour this October. I seem to be spending my time in different places all the time at the moment and in London. My dream is to headline the Royal Albert Hall.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HlbL6udXmf4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><em>You’ve been touring a lot. What’s your favourite thing about performing live?</em></p>
<p>Just playing the songs and connecting with all the people that have come to watch, it&#8217;s an amazing thing. It&#8217;s kind of like a therapy for me as well – pouring out all that emotion makes me feel so much better.</p>
<p><em>What’s been your most memorable moment from your tour so far?</em></p>
<p>When I played in Brussels with Rudimental – that was a crazy night. There were all the terrorist scares around at that point, so there was talk of pulling the show. But in the end everyone decided to go ahead with it and put fear to one side and it was a big moment.</p>
<p><em>You’re from Leicester and they’ve had a pretty phenomenal time lately – are you a football fan? What do you do to relax from music?</em></p>
<p>I used to play for Leicester Academy but music took over sport when I was younger! Football is a great way of getting away from music for a bit, especially if you&#8217;re a Leicester fan!</p>
<p><em>What else can we expect to see from you in the next year?</em></p>
<p>More music, a whole range of collaborations, again pushing my own boundaries when it comes to sound. I’ve got this UK tour in October and I’m getting more and more into live streaming on socials because there are lots of fans from around the world who I need to connect with.</p>

<p><em><strong>How did you all come together to make Anteros?</strong></em></p>
<p>Josh and I have been writing together for the last few years. He was the first person I ever wrote and recorded with. When we decided to start the band, we met Harry (drums) and Charles (guitar) – they joined last summer.</p>
<p><em><strong>Where did the name for the band come from? Obviously the God of Love, but why him?</strong></em></p>
<p>Well, we didn&#8217;t know what kind of project we were writing towards until we wrote <em>Anteros</em> the track. We used it as a reference to London (the statue in the middle of Piccadilly). We’re all from all over the place, but came together in London. The song defined the direction we wanted to go in, and represented us as a band.</p>
<p><em><strong>How would you describe your sound?</strong></em></p>
<p>Bitter Dream Pop.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d5UgKx-smx8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><em><strong>Tell us about your newest song The Beat.</strong></em></p>
<p>I was dumped via text because I was “too busy”. He sent it as I was on my way to the studio with Josh, so I switched my phone off and wrote all the things I wanted to tell him.</p>
<p><em><strong>Who are your musical influences?</strong></em></p>
<p>The list is endless. Our top three would probably be Blur, The Cure and No Doubt.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think are the main components of a good pop track?</strong></em></p>
<p>We’re still trying to figure that out! It’s hard to say as every song is different, and I feel they need to be treated that way. We have a thing for punchy bass lines, surf guitars, quirky drum patterns and upbeat choruses. But who really knows?</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YpE9Du0lMiE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><em><strong>Are you working on an album?</strong></em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s the goal. We never really stop writing, but we&#8217;re taking it one step at a time. We&#8217;re focusing on our EP release and upcoming tour in September.</p>
<p><em><strong>Your videos have a real kitsch element to them – where does that come from?</strong></em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really have the answer to that. All we aim to do is take whoever’s watching into a different world that is fun, light-hearted and full of colour. The guys say it&#8217;s like looking inside my brain&#8230;</p>
<p><em><strong>How much creative input do you have in your videos?</strong></em></p>
<p>We are all as hands on as possible with every step of the process. From the artwork (designed by Josh) to going into mixing and even mastering. The same applies to videos, Josh and I come up with the initial concept. We&#8217;ve worked closely with James &amp; James &#8211; as well as art director Fainche McCardle &#8211; on developing and making it a reality. The guys spend the whole day helping out at video shoots. It&#8217;s a team effort.</p>

<p><em><strong>You’ve been touring this year – what was your favourite gig and why?</strong></em></p>
<p>The more we play, the more we enjoy the gigs. So I&#8217;d probably go with our most recent set at Secret Garden Party. The sun was out, the vibe was right, and the crowd was great.</p>
<p><em><strong>How was Glastonbury?</strong></em></p>
<p>It was the muddiest dream come true. The Other Stage is <em>so big</em>. It was on all of our bucket lists, and none of us had been before, so we went for the whole weekend and had a great time. On the first day we walked over to see the stage we&#8217;d be playing on the Sunday and got very nervous, but the rain stayed away and the set ran smoothly. I think we all realised how much we enjoyed playing a stage that big &#8211; but most of all, now we know that we can. And we want to do it again.</p>
<p><em><strong>What can we expect to see from you for the rest of 2016?</strong></em></p>
<p>Our EP <em>Breakfast</em> is out in September, as well as a mini tour – with our first headline show in London at The Waiting Room on September 26th.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lefil.co.uk">Le Fil</a> is triple threat! As a model he&#8217;s been featured in Dazed &amp; Confused, i-D and Wallpaper*, as an artist, the Camberwell College of Arts grad has created work for The Barbican, Lady Gaga and English National Ballet andas a musician he released his debut EP &#8216;Pop Sculpture&#8217; in 2015.</p>
<p>Almost exactly a year later, he&#8217;s back with his second album, &#8216;Nightlife&#8217; &#8211; produced by <a href="http://www.frankmusik.com">Frankmusik</a> (Ellie Goulding / Sky Ferreira/ Erasure). &#8216;Nightlife&#8217; launches with the first single off the album &#8216;Genesis&#8217;, an epic futuristic dance-pop song inspired by the notion of the singularity and transhumanism. Le Fil tells us, “the song is about letting go of the past and embracing a better future that we can create for ourselves, whether that’s through coming together as culture, or through music or technology – its an optimistic anthem!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>We sat down with Le Fil to chat about gender, his time at UAL and of course his new single Genesis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The music industry is notoriously dominated by straight males, what&#8217;s it like navigating this space as an androgynous gay person?</strong></p>
<p>I’d say it&#8217;s no different to any other industry, you have your nice guys and your bad guys &#8211; and luckily every straight male I’ve worked with has been amazing. <a href="http://www.frankmusik.com/">Frankmusik</a>, who I’ve worked with on the production for my new EP, is completely straight and totally supports queer artists like Ru Paul and me. And he still gets people calling him gay. It’s swings and roundabouts, everyone has their own challenges and I try not to have this ‘them-against-us&#8217; mentality. We all should be judged for what creativity we bring to the table rather than by our sexual preferences. And being someone that knows how to dominate straight males anyway, its rather quite exciting- haha.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>There’s been such a shift in society&#8217;s views on gender in recent years, this shift is especially visible in the fashion industry, you were even in <a href="http://www.selfridges.com/GB/en/content/agender">Selfridges Agender </a>campaign, do you think a similar shift is occurring in the music industry?</strong></p>
<p>For me, music, fashion and art all fuse into each other so if there’s this seismic shift in one area, it totally has to feed into the other. The notion of a gender utopia is so colourful, that it makes sense to be inclusive. The world can’t stay monochrome with only these polarised depictions of gender within music. We have so many pretty, blonde, straight girls and hunky, straight guys with shaved heads flaunting their heterosexual, hypersexual image, that it’s time for the colourful and exciting ones in between to inject something new into that spectrum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;re a visual artist as well as musical artist, how do you marry/juggle these two mediums ? Why did you choose not to specialise? </strong></p>
<p>I like to bring everything together, hence the title of my first EP ‘Pop Sculpture&#8217;. Even my name Le Fil was chosen because it means ‘the thread’ in French, which to me is like this connection that weaves through all the disciplines and brings them together. It&#8217;s exciting to look at the areas between things, as that’s where there’s something new and undiscovered. The art world allows me to explore my crazy ideas uninhibited, and place them into the world of music which seems like there’s much more barriers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How has what you studied at UAL shaped your practice/who you are as an artist today?</strong></p>
<p>It taught me to look at things in new ways, and gave me confidence to be unconventional in my artistic vision. I also met my core group of friends, who are all creatives and we inspire each other to be the best versions of ourselves. 100% I wouldn’t be here making music if I hadn’t had gone through this self-exploratory phase as an artist. I&#8217;ve come to music a bit later than other people, but hopefully with a lot more understanding of who I am artistically and I think that comes across in everything I do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Genesis is an epic futuristic dance-pop song, what drew you to this genre?</strong></p>
<p>When I wrote Genesis, I was on an artist residency looking at transhumanism and learning about the Singularity, which is where humans integrate with technology. I love that idea of progressing mankind and creating something that improves our world and potential. In my head, its Fifth Element mixed with Matthew Barney’s River of Fundament and channeled with a church hymn! I love an exciting big pop song and Genesis certainly feels epic, especially now that Frankmusik has added his glossiness to it. It’s going to be the first single from my forthcoming Nightlife EP. Well there we go, I just announced the EP title too!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s been almost exactly a year since you dropped your debut EP Pop Sculpture, what’s life been like since?</strong></p>
<p>Pop Sculpture was so exciting for me. Releasing that EP led me to my eight month art residency with this massive company that supported me in making Nightlife. It was also the culmination of so many years, exhibitions and ideas that led to Pop Sculpture, so I’m very proud of the songs like ‘Black’ and ‘Future Is Now’. Especially recently, as I’ve been performing them all with a full live band at shows around London, and it’s been sounding epic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Highlight of your career so far? </strong></p>
<p>My highlight without a doubt is getting to make this new EP. Life as a new musician and artist is a constant hustle, and so many people never get to realise their ideas. It’s not like I’m signed to a label yet, so getting these new songs recorded and released independently is a massive feat for me &#8211; especially with all the talented collaborators I’ve worked with recently on the shows, photographs, videos and the music. Literally, I’m wetting myself over everything about this new EP. I can’t wait for you all to hear it.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Hopes for this year?</strong></p>
<p>That everyone’s gonna be power walking to Genesis on their way to work!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Kenzie May cut her teeth as a backing singer for some of the most exciting names in music, and now she is stepping out with her own music. Her voice is gorgeous and her songs are melodic. We caught up with the singer to talk about third culture kids, collaborations and her amazing song </em>Honey.</p>
<div id="attachment_13812" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-13812 size-large" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/04/NeverFindAnother-470x470.jpg" alt="Kenzie May.

<p><em><strong>How do you describe your sound?</strong></em></p>
<p>I try not to! I think ultimately it is pop music, but I don&#8217;t really know if that counts as a sound. There&#8217;s some soul and organic elements in there, even though it is mainly electronic or synthesised instrumentation. I think there&#8217;s something great about stuff that&#8217;s raw or not overly polished. I like things to have a bit of a rocky edge to them – I like crunch.</p>
<p><em><strong>You’re from Boston, but you were raised in London – how has your mixed upbringing influenced your music and style?</strong></em></p>
<p>I definitely grew up in a kind of &#8216;worlds colliding&#8217; Venn diagram. My family are all American so there are some influences from that side, but I moved to the UK when I was six so there&#8217;s also this deep affinity and collection of memories there. Then there are things that are unique to being a ‘third culture’ kid. You&#8217;re in the middle of both places which ironically makes you an outsider a lot of the time. That kind of forced me to embrace that otherness and try to create a space outside of &#8216;British vs. American&#8217;. A lot of people feel solace in claiming a place, which is cool, but I never really had that. Instead, I just kind of fall in love with everywhere I go, which I think reflects in my music and style and my life in general because I end up picking up references across a pretty broad spectrum.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EaCKVtEyIEs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><em><strong>London is recognised as one of the best cities for emerging musical talent – why do you think that is?</strong></em></p>
<p>People always talk about the massive amount of diversity in London and it&#8217;s so real. It&#8217;s full of transplants who are trying to find their place or create their own – that need to push boundaries and blur lines makes London one of the best places for breeding creativity.</p>
<p><em><strong>When did you first realise you had a gift for song-writing and singing?</strong></em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just always sang. I remember being like nine or ten years old and deciding that no one was going to write songs for me so I&#8217;d just have to do it for myself. It started out just melodies and lyrics and then I started putting chords together on piano or guitar. Vocally, I&#8217;ve definitely grown into my style, but it&#8217;s all been a learning curve.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5BX0eEzvtOI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
<em><strong>Tell us about Honey. We heard the video was inspired by the Nikos Kazantzakis quotation, “Once I saw a bee drown in honey, and I understood”. How is this relevant to the song and how did it come into the video? </strong></em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if it was necessarily inspired by the quote but the two definitely went hand in hand. From the time I wrote the song, I had a vision not dissimilar to the video, which was really cool to see come to fruition, albeit messy as hell. The quote itself is beautiful to me in its tragic implications. It&#8217;s this idea that even something sweet has the ability to destroy you, which is so true of love and relationships. It can be great, but the deeper you go, the harder it is to escape.</p>
<p><em><strong>You’ve worked with some amazing musicians such as Bastille, Metronomy and Sub Focus. Which has been your favourite collaboration and why?</strong></em></p>
<p>Most of the music I work on I see as a collaboration in some respect, whether it be with another artist or songwriter or producers. My favourites change, usually it&#8217;s just the most recent thing I&#8217;ve done, but it&#8217;s been incredible working with so many talented people. The most natural collaboration I would say has probably been with my guys Vindata. They&#8217;re mad talented, super easy going and it&#8217;s always just a good time getting in the studio with them. They recently remixed my song <em>Never Find Another</em>, and it&#8217;s crazy because their style is different to mine, but it just works. They just get it.</p>

Image via Dawbell</p></div>
<p><em><strong>Who else would you love to work with in the future?</strong></em></p>
<p>The list is ever-growing. There are a lot of musicians I&#8217;d love to just get in a room with, and I have a lot of talented friends I look forward to creating stuff with. I&#8217;m all for organic interactions when it comes to making music. If it&#8217;s meant to happen, it will.</p>
<p><em><strong>Will you be launching an album soon? If so, what can we expect?</strong></em></p>
<p>More music coming soon, and some kind of long play will definitely be happening sooner than later. I&#8217;ve been working on some stuff that I&#8217;m really stoked on.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you have plans to tour?</strong></em></p>
<p>For sure, when I can drag myself away from the studio. The live shows are going to be special.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://roycewoodjunior.com/">Royce Wood Junior</a> is something of a musical Jack of all trades &#8211; songwriter, musician, producer and singer &#8211; and has collaborated with some great names in the electronic and alternative music scene such Jamie Woon, Kwabs and Nao. Now he is stepping out on his own with his Deluxe album </em>The Ashen Tang<em> and talks to P&amp;P about the joys of uncompromising, losing yourself in performance and gigs were no one claps.</em></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-12805" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/02/ROYCE-WOOD-JUNIOR-2-470x325.jpg" alt="ROYCE WOOD JUNIOR 2" width="470" height="325" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/02/ROYCE-WOOD-JUNIOR-2-470x325.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/02/ROYCE-WOOD-JUNIOR-2-310x215.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/02/ROYCE-WOOD-JUNIOR-2-300x208.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/02/ROYCE-WOOD-JUNIOR-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>
<p><em>How did you start out?</em></p>
<p>I started out as a guitar player. I formed a band and adopted the Noel Gallagher template of being the principle songwriter and lead guitarist and went from there.</p>
<p><em>How would you describe your sound?</em></p>
<p>There’s not really a catchy way of describing it. I think music is best left uncategorised simply because of how difficult it is to do. It’s informed by so much but two major components are soul and electronica.</p>
<p><em>Who are your musical influences?</em></p>
<p>Stevie, Prince, Aphex Twin, J Dilla, Rufus Wainwright, Radiohead, Björk, Dj Shadow, Bill Evans, Forss… a huge un-abating list.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H_HonEsYHEA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><em>You released your album last year, The Ashen Tang. What was your aim with this album?</em></p>
<p>To make something broad that had a little corner reserved for every style of music that I like, something that documented my most interesting writing to date.</p>
<p><em>Where did the name come from?</em></p>
<p>It’s another way of saying ‘bittersweet’</p>
<p><em>You&#8217;ve just released the Deluxe version of the album – what made you want to add to the album?</em></p>
<p>There were a few songs that I had to leave off for various reasons but this way I can give them a run out. They were always meant to be part of it but I couldn’t squeeze them into the original.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-12807" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/02/RWJ-PressShot1-2-470x705.jpg" alt="RWJ-PressShot1 2" width="470" height="705" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/02/RWJ-PressShot1-2-470x705.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/02/RWJ-PressShot1-2-310x465.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/02/RWJ-PressShot1-2-300x450.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/02/RWJ-PressShot1-2.jpg 667w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>
<p><em>What’s your favourite song on the album and why?</em></p>
<p>My favourite song is <em>Ophelia</em> because it’s the geekiest musically &#8211; it’s all majors but it sounds melancholy and that was the challenge when I wrote it.</p>
<p><em>What do you enjoy about performing live?</em></p>
<p>I’m usually in and out of the moment but I like the bits where you actually aren’t aware explicitly of what you’re doing – sometimes 3 or 4 minutes can go by and then you get a jolt of reality that reminds you that you’re playing a show. You have no idea what you did for those 3 or 4 minutes but that means that you were in the zone which hopefully is a good thing. It could also mean that you’ve absent-mindedly been playing complete bullshit for 3 or 4 minutes…</p>
<p><em>What’s been your favourite gig so far?</em></p>
<p>I did one recently in Renne that was met with nothing but a tiny ripple of golf claps but the onstage sound was so good that it felt great at the time – they hated it but we all enjoyed it.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2hAQnm_9m0Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><em>You’ve worked with some amazing people – Kwabs, Jamie Woon and Rosie Lowe. What’s been one of your favourite collaborations and why?</em></p>
<p>Hard to pick a favourite – Jamie’s the longest one, we’ve done all sorts of different tunes together for ages. Jono McCleery was great because we did an entire record together and barely spent one day of it in the same room (which is modern and crazy). I also like the stuff I write with Nao – we’ve got such different tastes that there’s this kind of friction based alchemy that mostly good stuff emerges from. Denai Moore too.</p>
<p><em>Do you prefer working on your own projects or do you like working and collaborating with others more?</em></p>
<p>I like them both for different reasons. It’s a bit one-dimensional to just write on your own and you can easily find yourself in cul-de-sacs using the same old ideas and styles and techniques. Writing with others helps to shake the dust off and see things through someone else&#8217;s eyes. That said, it’s also nice to return to a compromise-free environment sometimes, where you get to make all of the decisions.</p>
<p><em>You’re recognised as a songwriter, singer, producer and musician – if you only be one for the rest of your career, which one would it be and why?</em></p>
<p>Definitely songwriter – that’s number one. All the other stuff is all merely in support of that.</p>
<p><em>What can we expect next from you?</em></p>
<p>Some collaborations, some remixes, and starting on the second record. And probably some more plagiarised artwork…</p>

<p>There is something very special about Marlon Williams. It might be his distinctive voice, his captivating songs or the emotionally-charged lyrics, but his music has the power to take you away to another place, to another time. Combining old world country with cinematic resonances, this artist&#8217;s music has a uniqueness and longevity that is so rare in music these days. Here, Darcy Rive asks Williams about his upcoming album, tour and pursuing a solo career.</p>
<div id="attachment_12407" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-12407" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/bannerImage3-470x205.jpg" alt="Image via marlonwilliams.co.nz" width="470" height="205" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/bannerImage3-470x205.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/bannerImage3-310x135.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/bannerImage3-300x131.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/bannerImage3.jpg 957w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Image via marlonwilliams.co.nz</p></div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>You have such a unique and gorgeous voice. How would describe your sound?</strong></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>I usually go with &#8216;folk music&#8217; as an evasively simple descriptor. Folk music filtered through a bluegrass/alt rock lens? Dunno really&#8230;</p>
<div>
<div dir="ltr">
<div>
<div>
<div><strong>Your music has quite a country bent to it. Who are your musical influences?</strong></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>There you go, country! I certainly cut my teeth on a lot of Hank Williams, George Jones and early Elvis as a young man and that presence always seems to shine through but I listen to all sorts of shit so it&#8217;s hard to say with any clarity.</p>
<div>
<div dir="ltr">
<div>
<div>
<div><strong>There is something really cinematic about your music, as if they belong in a Quentin Tarantino film. Is this something you’ve heard before or something you think yourself?</strong></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A lot of the music I listen to and enjoy comes from the same musical era Tarantino draws from which is I guess  where that feeling comes from. I&#8217;d love to score a film at some point and I actually saw Tarantino in a cafe in LA recently so maybe it&#8217;s all gonna happen for me.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ow8qMY8JkR0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<div>
<div dir="ltr">
<div>
<div>
<div><strong>I absolutely love <i>Hello, Miss Lonesome </i>– what’s the story behind this song?</strong></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>It&#8217;s really a very simple song, one of the easiest songs I&#8217;ve written. It&#8217;s that classic country trope of that feeling of loneliness personified as a woman. It&#8217;s been done a lot and will be done a lot more I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p><strong>Your cover of <em>The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face</em> is absolutely beautiful – do you have any other songs in mind that you’d love to cover and give your unique spin?</strong></p>
<p>I love playing other peoples songs. It&#8217;s a massive part of the folk tradition, stripping music of ego, making it faceless and impersonal.</p>
<p><strong>What can we expect from your new album?</strong></p>
<p>A diverse collection of songs, some my own, some not, that all (hopefully) are strung together by the power of sangin&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong>Each song on the new album is a different character. Can you tell us a little bit about each character?</strong></p>
<p>They&#8217;re all shades of characters, incomplete and intentionally so. They&#8217;re linked by common facts of life &#8211; tragedy, love, loneliness, but they&#8217;re necessarily light so as to let the listener build them up as they need to.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TB_jcFax5kM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>How involved are you in development of your music videos, which all have something of a melancholic story to them?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m involved to the point of choosing the pitch and the director and yeah, I always seem to go for the sad, strange vibes. Next one will be funny and light, I swear.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favourite thing about performing live to your fans?</strong></p>
<p>No matter how tired you are, playing live to people always reinvigorates you. The adrenaline is totally necessary to get through gruelling, long tours. The other great thing is how songs change depending on who you play them to. New audiences bring new perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>What’s been your most memorable live solo performance, and why?</strong></p>
<p>Playing in my hometown of Lyttelton in NZ on a friday night, going to the airport straight after the show, flying to Sydney, getting there at 7am then going to the Sydney Opera House to play a small set in the main hall was mindblowing. You get to the end of a day like that and have to pinch yourself.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZX5WwRv9E-8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Do you have plans to tour?</strong></p>
<p>I do &#8211; I’ll be back in April once the albums been out for a while to do a run of shows with my band.</p>
<p><strong>You were part of a successful band from a young age – what made you want to pursue a solo career?</strong></p>
<p>Playing solo was something I always did alongside playing in the band for a bit of extra cash so it was pretty seamless a transition. I guess I was nervous and excited at the prospect  of putting something out under my own name. All the responsibility and praise falls on you.</p>
<p><strong>What can we hope to see from you in 2016? </strong></p>
<div>
<div>
<div>A fair whack of touring and hopefully another record later on in the year.</div>
</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://www.entervaults.com">Vaults </a></em>are just beautiful &#8211; there&#8217;s no other way to describe them. Beautifully melancholic, beautifully uplifted, beautifully grounded. Their sound is a blend of synth and classical with dreamy vocals and heartfelt words. We caught up with singer Blythe to talk about the band&#8217;s origins, cinematic videos and future album.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-12015" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/vaults-470x353.jpg" alt="vaults" width="470" height="353" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/vaults-470x353.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/vaults-310x233.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/vaults-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/vaults.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>
<p><strong>How did the band come together?</strong></p>
<p>Barney and Ben met ages ago at university, and I met Barney&#8217;s girlfriend roller-skating. When I moved to London, I started to gig a bit and Barney and Mel came to a gig. He approached me after to ask if I&#8217;d be interested to hear the music he and Ben had been making and it went from there. When <em>Cry No More</em> hit the ground running, it was obviously something to follow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Where did the name Vaults come from?</strong></p>
<p>We really liked the letter V which Ben’s girlfriend had made into a logo that we really loved and Vaults was a word which summoned up a sense of the hidden stories in the music and the idea of suppressed emotions finding a way to being released.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l2lgm1rwjXY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>How would you describe your sound?</strong></p>
<p>Orchestrated Synth Pop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Who are your musical influences?</strong></p>
<p>Too many to put down. From classical to dance, soul, folk, pop, rock, indie. We all have seriously eclectic tastes &#8211; how could you not these days with such easy access to different music?</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NDfrS-uvI0Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Your song <em>One Last Night</em> was featured on the Fifty Shades of Grey soundtrack – how did that come about?</strong></p>
<p>We were approached with the opportunity to put a song forward and so we shot some different numbers over. Over a meeting with the directer Sam Taylor-Wood, and having watched the scene (the only one without spanking unfortunately), we felt it was a good fit and ok’d it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Have you been working on an album? </strong></p>
<p>Yes we have. Its been a while coming so we are looking forward to putting it out for sure. It will be surprising to some of our more electronic fans as it has quite a lot of soul in there too, and there are a lot of different textures and arks which we hope will give a varied experience to the listening.</p>
<div id="attachment_12017" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-12017" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/Vaults-03-please-credit-Eliot-Lee-Hazel-470x313.jpg" alt="Image by Eliot Lee Hazel" width="470" height="313" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/Vaults-03-please-credit-Eliot-Lee-Hazel-470x313.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/Vaults-03-please-credit-Eliot-Lee-Hazel-310x207.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/Vaults-03-please-credit-Eliot-Lee-Hazel-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/01/Vaults-03-please-credit-Eliot-Lee-Hazel.jpg 980w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Image by Eliot Lee Hazel</p></div>
<p><strong>What’s your favourite thing about performing live to your fans?</strong></p>
<p>Looking at them in the eyes and showing that I’m not afraid to connect with them even though they are strangers. That’s the best thing about live music &#8211; getting together with people in a space and seeing what happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Some of your videos are really cinematic and beautiful – what’s your involvement in how they’re developed?</strong></p>
<p>Ben often writes the music to inspiring imagery/films and I get a lot of energy from that being translated into the music. Then remaking the music into video image &#8211; it&#8217;s really a process of letting your brain amble in a dark room and jump and go fantastic and then see if you can make that happen. I love it &#8211; it&#8217;s so much fun. We work closely with the directors &#8211; all incredible in their own way and try to pinpoint the best bits of their ideas and feed in our own ideas to that.  We also try to be very visual in our live performance.   Live, it’s our show so we do whatever we like (within budget!) and find others to help us realize the ideas. Live, you are constricted by venue and the fact people need to receive the music and see you play instruments but there is still so much you can do.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bV6eaF0iAxs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>What’s been your favourite video to shoot and why?</strong></p>
<p>Oh wow, that is difficult because they were all amazing and hard in different ways. I think <em>Poison</em> has to be my favourite precisely because it was the most harrowing. It was directed by my brother Matthew Hart in New York City on a minuscule budget and the fact that it wasn’t for a single and wasn’t big budget yet the idea was super-ambitious made the process really tough but so rewarding. 48 hours of being wet and cold and thinking really dark thoughts to get into character intercut with hanging out with some of the best and most generous crew all giving their time for hardly anything &#8211; so heartening! Great memories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You have a really distinctive aesthetic – is something you’ve curated as a band? Is fashion something that is really important to the band?</strong></p>
<p>Do we? Thanks! You know I don’t think we can really see this objectively. We feel what the music is and we take it from there. Everything leads back to the music &#8211; the meaning of the lyrics, the feeling of the musical choices. It’s brooding and suspended and awkward and then luscious and sparkly. We certainly don’t look at ourselves as fashionistas! We wear whatever we feel like! Maybe the only extra factor for the band is that we want to create something magical for our fans and ourselves when we are performing &#8211; its a vessel for expression and excitement on both sides of the stage..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What can we expect from Vaults in 2016?</strong></p>
<p>Lots of gigs, the release of our first album, and some unusual live shows plus collaboration with other artists and exhibition style performing. Don’t want to give everything away though&#8230;</p>

<p><em>Where did the name </em>Ella On The Run<em> come from?</em></p>
<p>Ella is my middle name and I always wanted to use it to create some kind of artist name. ‘On The Run’ just adds to the mystery as I want the focus to be on the music and less on the persona. It also represents the constant evolution I would like my music to go through.</p>
<p><em>Did you always want to work in music, or is it something that you came to later?</em></p>
<p>I have been singing pretty much since I can remember and I have a degree in music so the easy answer is yes! That said, I did a lot of other things too in the last 10 years that I really love, like a chef&#8217;s degree and working in interior design. I like most creative things, to be honest, and can see myself doing multiple roles in the future, even if music is my number one passion.</p>
<p><em>How would you describe your sound?</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s always an interesting question as my sound has already evolved from the first release to the most recent. I would call it quirky yet dark synth-pop or alt-pop, but in a broader term it is definitely pop.</p>

<p><em><br />
Who are your musical influences?</em></p>
<p>I have loads of musical influences from all genres. I think it’s hard to pinpoint one specific artist today that influences me more than others, as I think my sound is an amalgamation of all the music I listened to growing up &#8211; from Ace of Base to Nina Simone right back to Erykah Badu or N.E.R.D. I take a little inspiration from all of them, even if it is just a word or the whole lyrical approach or a single snare or guitar sound I happen to like on an old album.</p>
<p><em>And your favourite singers and artists at the moment?</em></p>
<p>Are you ready? The list is long! I am currently listening to loads of Shura, Kate Boy, Jack Garrett, David Bowie, Taylor Swift, some deep house DJs like Janoma or NU, Feist, True, Charlotte OC, St.Vincent and FKA Twigs and many many more! I have started curating some <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/ellaontherun/playlist/1bRTK5g8NGlchQ4OW3BMQ9">Spotify playlists</a> so if you want to see what rocks my boat feel free to follow me!<br />
<em><br />
Has your mixed heritage of Swiss, French and South-African influenced your own music or the music that you like?</em></p>
<p>I think all external, as well as internal, life factors play a major role in the creative process. I had the fortune to grow up with English as a mother tongue in an otherwise German-speaking part of the country so I was obviously at an advantage in song writing. I have also been traveling the world since I was young and that has opened my mind to many different music styles and artists. Next year, for instance I will be going to a sacred music festival in India, which I am very excited about!</p>
<p><em>What’s your approach to writing music? </em></p>
<p>To be honest the process is always different. Sometimes I already have some lyrical ideas and sometimes we start with a beat and I get inspired by that. It also depends on who I am writing with or if I am working on something alone. I think, like most artists, I draw inspiration from my personal life or stories that inspire me.</p>
<p><em>You’ve been played on BBC Radio 1 – what’s it like when you first hear your music played on the radio?</em><br />
The first time I got played I actually missed it! So I listened to a repeat online the next day! As a child of the &#8216;radio generation&#8217;, it was obviously a huge deal for me as it is something I wished for since I was a kid. I guess maybe times have changed a little but the feeling of achievement is still mind-blowing.</p>

<p><em>What do you love most about performing live?</em></p>
<p>Sharing what I do with my fans is probably the most rewarding experience. I spend so much time working on the songs and recording them that when I finally get to perform them and see the positive reception first hand, it’s a pretty awesome feeling.<br />
<em>What has been your favourite/most memorable show so far?</em></p>
<p>My most memorable show so far was opening for Tove Stryke at the Hoxton Bar &amp; Gill earlier this year. The fans were amazing, as was Tove!</p>
<p><em>Your video for Golden Boys was shot around London. At the moment, London is really being recognised as a great city for emerging music and talent – what do you think makes London such a great city for music?</em></p>
<p>I agree that London is a great city for emerging talent, that’s why I&#8217;m here! I do think that London has always been Europe’s music capital with a unique talent to create something that is outside the box. I strongly believe that because London is such a melting pot of different cultures, the creative input is much more eclectic creating interesting new sounds and artists that are pushing boundaries!</p>
