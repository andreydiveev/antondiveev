				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Darren Kennedy – writer, stylist, presenter and designer – knows fashion. A guest contributor to <em>The Telegraph</em>’s online lifestyle channel <em>Telegraph Men</em> and a regular presenter of the fashion segment on ITV1’s <em>This Morning</em>, Kennedy also designs a range of men’s suits in collaboration with tailor Louis Copeland. In 2013, he was awarded <em>Most Stylish Man in Ireland</em>. In 2012, Kennedy’s personal documentary <em>Gay Daddy, </em>which explored attitudes towards and options for gay people looking to start a family, was a viral hit. Here, he talks to editor Darcy Rive about his shoe addiction, the blogger backlash and how success can come from a cup of tea.</p>
<div id="attachment_10812" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-10812 size-large" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/10/IMG_4262-2-470x705.jpg" alt="IMG_4262 2" width="470" height="705" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/10/IMG_4262-2-470x705.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/10/IMG_4262-2-310x465.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/10/IMG_4262-2-300x450.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/10/IMG_4262-2.jpg 667w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Image by Kyle Galvin</p></div>
<p><em>You’ve received awards for how you dress. How do you describe your personal style?</em></p>
<p>I sum it up as tailored with an urban edge. The fit is very important to me so I wear a lot of suits. Shoes could be my downfall – I can never walk away from an eye-catching pair of shoes or trainers. Designers are getting so creative now with men’s shoes in terms of fabric, colours and shape. I have a pair from YMC that I adore and ox blood Tommy Hilfiger loafers that I live in and a lovely pair of Nicholas Kirkwood desert boots that I can’t wait to wear. I have a bit of a shoe problem.</p>
<p><em>You’re a successful fashion columnist, presenter, stylist and your suit collection has sold out. Did you always want to work in fashion?</em></p>
<p>From a young age, I always had an opinion on fashion. As cliché as it sounds, I used to help my mother get dressed. But when I was in school, I never really considered it as a career option, as something you could make a life out of, so I studied business and languages at university and I studied in Bordeaux before living in Paris for a year. I was enjoying everything, soaking everything up including lots of wine.</p>
<p>In my twenties I was working in TV, which I love but which can be fickle – you’re working on someone else’s projects and as soon as you’ve given everything you’ve got, you move onto another project. I was working on a TV show and wanted a way to nurture my own creativity – fashion just kept on coming up again and again. So I set up a blog, did some part-time course at Central Saint Martins, set up my own styling business and then my two worlds collided. There was a natural synergy between what I was doing in television and what I was doing outside of it. They became mutually beneficial and both have flourished.</p>
<p><em>In terms of fashion, London is leading the way for emerging talent and is a huge driving force behind the interest in menswear. Why do you think that is?</em></p>
<p>London has that mix of heritage and creativity and the global standard of designer that are respected and wanted and, more to the point, who push the boundaries a bit more. There are household names like Burberry alongside new talent from the likes of Fashion East, and that’s what makes London such a formidable force. Fashion has been so fixated on womenswear for such a long time and menswear has been in the shadows. But in recent years, men have rediscovered the fun that you can have with clothes on a very practical level.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C32BTK8pUXY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><em>There is a huge focus now on fashion and the environment, and typically the advice is to buy investment pieces. As a designer yourself and fashion commentator, what are your thoughts on sustainability?</em></p>
<p>I look at my own wardrobe and I see investment pieces alongside pieces that come and go. Over time, I value the investment pieces. It’s easy to end up with so many clothes and you don’t need them. Life is simpler when you have less. It’s easy to say ‘buy investment pieces’ but if you don’t have much money, you can’t afford to spend x amount on an investment piece. It’s all well and good to say that from an ivory tower.</p>
<p>A lot of the responsibility is with the brands. We need to look at sustainability seriously and not just ticking a box, and that’s where fashion and technology collide. I don’t have the answer but it’s not about saying ‘buy investment pieces and everything will be fine’. That’s oversimplifying it a bit.</p>
<p><em>You’re a much-respected writer and commentator, and you began with your own blog. Nowadays it feels like there is a bit of a backlash in the fashion industry against bloggers. What is your opinion of blogging?</em></p>
<p>I’ve never considered myself a blogger. I did start a website but I never see myself as a blogger in terms of career and driving force. There has been a generation of bloggers who lost perspective on what they do and where they’re coming from. There are many great bloggers out there who are well respected but they’ve earned their stripes. But in certain circles there is a sense of entitlement and just because you have a blog doesn’t mean you are the number one fashion authority.</p>
<p>That said, the blogosphere has absolutely opened doors and democratised fashion. It’s not just Anna Wintour and her ilk who have a voice now and that’s a fantastic thing. I come from a very ordinary, working class background and I remember thinking that industries like television and fashion have closed doors. But actually, once you set out and make an effort, any barrier can be broken down. For people starting out now, it has to come from a place of authenticity. When blogs first started, people weren’t doing it to become popular and make lots of money. Your starting point is very important.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ANVDxtTIDwI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><em>As well as your success in fashion, you were behind the hit documentary Gay Daddy. What compelled you to make the show?</em></p>
<p><strong> </strong>Fashion is one part of what I do. It is something I enjoy but it absolutely doesn’t define me. I worked as a journalist and broadcaster for years before fashion, so for me, it’s about constantly learning and ticking over. I feel privileged because I’m able to do different things.</p>
<p>I did <em>Gay Daddy </em>because I reached a stage in my life where a lot of friends and family were having children and I started questioning if it was something that was going to happen in my life. I had so many questions and no answers. I spoke with a producer friend and it got commissioned and I had to have a real discussion with myself and my family – it was far more personal than anything I’d done before. I’m so glad I did – it was a fantastic journey and it really got the conversation going.</p>
<p><em>Your home country Ireland was the first country in the world to legalise gay marriage by public vote. What did that mean for you as an openly gay Irish man? </em></p>
<p>When I did <em>Gay Daddy, </em>I found that most people in Ireland are actually happy for you just to be happy. The happier people are individually, the better society is. That was the message sent from the referendum result. The whole country, whether from a small village or big city, had an open discussion and voted that people had the right to show their love. I’m very proud of my country and the referendum result.</p>
<p><em>What advice do you have for young creatives starting out now?</em></p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if it’s a creative industry or not, the most important thing, wherever you want to work, is to give everything you do 110%. That applies especially at the beginning of your career. Most people start off doing things that they don’t necessarily want to do but it’s not about saving yourself and giving 150% when you’re doing what you want to do. If you’re asked to make a cup of tea, obviously you don’t want to be a tea maker, that’s not your goal in life, but make the best possible cup of tea you can. Show that you’re hard-working and determined and that you don’t have notions of yourself. People notice these things and they will help you flourish. Never underestimate the small things you do.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Womenswear label Lapidarium was founded by LCF students Marta Gos and Martyna Sobczak who met on the BA Fashion Design Technology Menswear course. The graduates&#8217; collection </em>See It Through<em> is showcased on designer platform <a href="https://www.notjustalabel.com/designer/lapidarium"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Not Just A Label</span></a>. Comprised of five outfits, it was also recently featured online at Vogue Italia and won the Fashion Designer Awards in Poland last year. C<em>reating new patterns and textures that play around the concept of digital print illusion, t</em>he majority of textiles used within the collection have either been created by the designers themselves (using heating press or needle felting machines) or are made up of recycled offcuts from previous projects. Pigeons &amp; Peacocks spoke to the women behind the brand.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><a ref="magnificPopup" href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/06/Lapidarium_64A7138-final-web.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9578" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/06/Lapidarium_64A7138-final-web.jpg" alt="caucasian model wearing short sleeved graphic dress by design duo lapidarium" width="708" height="944" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/06/Lapidarium_64A7138-final-web.jpg 708w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/06/Lapidarium_64A7138-final-web-310x413.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/06/Lapidarium_64A7138-final-web-470x626.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/06/Lapidarium_64A7138-final-web-300x400.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 708px) 100vw, 708px" /></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong>P&amp;P: Have you always wanted to design? How did your journey into design begin?</strong></p>
<p>Lapidarium: We always wanted to design and were interested in fashion, especially<br />
fashion as a form of art. Our experience began a few years ago when we<br />
were studying fashion in Poland. We didn’t know each other at the time.<br />
Through different work experience in the fashion industry we still have the<br />
same passion but we are much more fashion-conscious.</p>
<p><a ref="magnificPopup" href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/06/lapidarium_64A7202-final-web.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9580" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/06/lapidarium_64A7202-final-web.jpg" alt="model looking over her shoulder wearing jacket and skirt with graphic print by design duo lapidarium" width="708" height="944" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/06/lapidarium_64A7202-final-web.jpg 708w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/06/lapidarium_64A7202-final-web-310x413.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/06/lapidarium_64A7202-final-web-470x626.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/06/lapidarium_64A7202-final-web-300x400.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 708px) 100vw, 708px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>P&amp;P: Can you tell me about your background?</strong></p>
<p>Marta: I am from Warsaw, Poland, where I studied Fashion and English<br />
Studies. After completing my diploma I moved to London to<br />
study at LCF because I was really passionate about menswear.</p>
<p>Martyna: I am also from Poland. I began my fashion journey at the Cracow<br />
Fashion School, then moved to London to continue my adventure in fashion.<br />
LCF was a place I really dreamed of.</p>
<p><strong>P&amp;P: How did your background influence your work?</strong></p>
<p>Marta: I think that my background does not influence my work so much, rather, it is<br />
the environment and experiences in general.</p>
<p>Martyna: I guess my studies in Poland helped me realise that I want to<br />
push myself and be able to learn much more. This is why I moved to<br />
London. In my opinion it is one of the best places to study fashion.</p>
<p><a ref="magnificPopup" href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/06/Lapidarium_64A7280-final-web.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9581" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/06/Lapidarium_64A7280-final-web.jpg" alt="model wearing a short-sleeved turtle neck dress in grey and white with graphic print by design duo lapidarium" width="708" height="944" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/06/Lapidarium_64A7280-final-web.jpg 708w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/06/Lapidarium_64A7280-final-web-310x413.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/06/Lapidarium_64A7280-final-web-470x626.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/06/Lapidarium_64A7280-final-web-300x400.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 708px) 100vw, 708px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>P&amp;P: What were you inspired by for your final collection &#8216;See It Through&#8217;?</strong></p>
<p>Marta: We started experimenting with recycled fabrics, leftovers we<br />
had from previous projects. The main inspiration were 20s/30s fashion,<br />
because it was the theme of the competition we sent our application to.</p>
<p>Martyna: We transformed the silhouette into a more modern and sporty one and<br />
the fabrics we used were a distorted inspiration of the shiny, sophisticated<br />
fabrics of that period.</p>
<p><strong>P&amp;P: How would you describe your aesthetic?</strong></p>
<p>Lapidarium: We like a modern, clear and shaped silhouette, but also relaxed<br />
chic. We focus on making garments with an interesting cut but mainly we<br />
experiment with textures, prints and fabrics.  The goal of this company is<br />
to merge a particular aesthetic with an emphasis on sustainability. We are<br />
committed to raise an awareness to the craft and character of &#8216;made in the<br />
UK&#8217; products by focusing on high quality luxurious designs.</p>

<p><strong>P&amp;P: What are you up to next?</strong></p>
<p>Lapidarium: We are working on our first collection that we plan to showcase this<br />
September. We are very excited to see the results!</p>

<p><em>With the release of her second album, we spend five minutes getting to know the soul-singing sensation Andreya Triana and playing her new material on repeat.</em></p>

<p><strong>Your sophomore album has now been released – how are you feeling?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m feeling great, really excited and glad the pre-release fear has now gone!</p>
<p><strong>What the process of creating this album? How involved were you in writing the tracks and the final sound of the album?</strong></p>
<p>Being involved in writing my own material and the overall sound is really important to me. All the songs are very personal and honest and I take inspiration from things I&#8217;ve experienced in every day life. The album was recorded in Matt Hales (aka. Aqualung) studio in LA and we had a great time making crazy sounds and layering up lots of harmonies.</p>
<p><strong>Do you feel this album is a growth from your first one? What lessons have you learned along the way?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I definitely feel this album is a step on for my first album. I feel it&#8217;s stronger in terms of the sound and songwriting. I had really limited resources when writing my first album and just really wanted to push myself as much as I could. The lesson I learned is you just have to keep going until it feels right.</p>

<p><strong>You&#8217;re recognised as a self taught singer &#8211; when you first discover your talent?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always loved singing since I was really little and just kept on doing it! I feel like I&#8217;m discovering new parts of my voice all the time.</p>
<p><strong>How did you find your signature sound?</strong></p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s always within you but I also had to do lots of experimenting to see what felt right to me and what I enjoyed doing most. It&#8217;s an ever-evolving process and I try to be as open as possible.</p>
<p><strong>How did growing up in London, one of the most multi-cultural cities in the world, affect your style and sound?</strong></p>
<p>It had a huge influence, I was surrounded by so many different types of people and cultures. It really opens your mind and I think it all had an input into what my sound is today.</p>

<p><strong>Tell us about the time you spent at the Red Bull Music Academy.</strong></p>
<p>I was selected to go to Melbourne in 2006 and it was the most incredible experience. I got to meet so many amazing musicians and producers. I met Flying Lotus there as he was a participant too and that&#8217;s where we recorded a track called &#8216;Tea Leaf Dancers&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve had the opportunity to work with some amazing artists including Bonobo, Flying Lotus, Breach and Lapalux. What&#8217;s that like?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been great working with all of those guys – they&#8217;re all so talented! My dream collaboration would be with Jamie Lidell and great singer and songwriter I discovered recently called Son Little.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-8928" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/04/Michael-Angelakos-Passion-Pit-470x352.jpg" alt="Michael Angelakos Passion Pit" width="470" height="352" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/04/Michael-Angelakos-Passion-Pit-470x352.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/04/Michael-Angelakos-Passion-Pit-310x232.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/04/Michael-Angelakos-Passion-Pit-300x224.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>
<p>“It’s pretty fucking honest. If you’re going to go there, then go there – you really can’t half-ass it,” says Michael Angelakos, lead singer of indie pop band Passion Pit, whose biggest hit song <em>Take A Walk</em> was played on repeat across radio stations and student union bars back in 2012. The band is back now with a new album called <em>Kindred</em>, released this week, and as with their previous records <em>Manners </em>and <em>Gossamer, </em>it deals with some pretty personal issues set against their signature anthemic sound. “It’s like a curated diary. You have to put yourself out there and make yourself vulnerable – that’s what makes Passion Pit so special to me, because opening yourself up to people is one of the hardest things in the world.”</p>
<p>When you’re talking to Angelakos, it’s easy to be distracted by the pleasant lilt in his voice, his attractive face or his charming manner, without realising that what he is talking about is very honest and open and a little raw. It’s the same with his songs – he sings about alcoholism and bipolar disorder with a euphoric refrain that has qualities of gospel transcendence and pop happiness. “Isn’t that the best way to deal with these types of issues? The hardest things in life are so often, in terms of art, matched with darkness and all things minor. That’s so obvious to me and it’s not really human. We carry a load of emotion with us everywhere so that there is never only one emotion in anything we say or do. I don’t think a Passion Pit record is ever a single narrative or single emotion, so the dichotomy between sonic and lyrics is the most human, natural element. I think it’s more honest than anything else.”</p>
<p>Honesty is a big part of what Angelakos does, the way he is and how he writes. “All the narratives come naturally and honestly. The songs write themselves after a while because you get so excited by a sound or a refrain and it builds itself out.”</p>
<p><em>Kindred, </em>however, is a new step for Passion Pit as Angelakos explores a more restrained sound in his writing. “It’s so easy for me to let it go and be big – that’s the easiest thing in the world. I can just keep on going and going. Editing and pulling yourself back in any regard – lyrically or sonically – is very difficult to do. With this record, I simplified everything, especially lyrically. I think this is the first record where instead of just saying, ‘I like that challenge’, I actually did impose that challenge on myself. When we were tracking drums for the record, I refused to allow even a crash cymbal. I just wanted to see how much restraint I could exercise and how much I could pull back on this record while still making these big Passion Pit songs.” When listening to <i>Kindred, </i>the style has definitely evolved but it is still most definitely a Passion Pit record.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s the sonic restraint, the lyrical honesty, the growth of the signature Passion Pit sound or the place where Angelakos is personally when he is writing – whatever it is, it works. In a very neat and concise ten tracks, <em>Kindred </em>is a heady mix of lo-fi electro pop with digressions into 2000s indie that can overpower but is ultimately very uplifting. “I felt like these ten songs got to the point quicker and covered all the territory that I wanted to cover.”</p>
<p>This is an album that questions that notion of family. In <em>Gossamer, </em>Angelakos wrote about his girlfriend and her role in him overcoming these personal struggles; <em>Kindred </em>is written to his now wife, and the many other people that affect his life. “The album title came from talking about this person who came into my life and had this huge impact on me, and this idea of a kindred soul. This record is about family, what constitutes family and what you make of it. This blood relation notion that we have of family is kind of silly when you think about it – the people who feel most like family don’t always relate with blood. People continually say that it’s about my wife or my brother here or there – no, it’s not that blatant. To me, that is boring. When you’re writing, you use these characters and scenarios and the people in your life to illustrate larger points and <em>Kindred </em>speaks about family and other issues like paranoia. These human issues are embedded into the songs.”</p>
<p>Angelakos has a wonderful way of being open about what he is thinking and feeling, and this is what is poured into his songs. While Passion Pit is developing in sound and style, Angelakos is growing in heart and mind. “I’m at a point in my life, I’m almost 28 and I’m trying to figure out how to improve my life in certain ways, like being better at accepting love and loving myself and loving all these people around me who have been so wonderful to me and who I don’t feel like I have appreciated. For me, I always just wanted to connect with people and I have a really hard time doing that in real life – music has always been an easier way of going about it.”</p>
<p>What is so striking is the dichotomy between Angelakos’s openness to talk and sing about his struggles with alcohol and bipolar disorder and his own awareness of his vulnerability as well as the front which he, by his own admission, built up. “One of the ways I was able to begin connecting with people was by completely shattering this wall I had put up which has been shielding people from knowing that I had this illness. I had to open up in such a drastic way so that I could make sense of it and connect with people. You have to talk openly about an illness like that and you have to stick up for other people who have it. I feel honoured that some people might think of me as an ambassador. I am constantly trying to raise awareness of it. My music is my therapy and it helps me to connect with people on a normal level. That’s just the way it goes.”</p>
<p>Surely it it is this openness that makes his songs so fantastic, so multi-layered and so representative of who he is. Angelakos and Passion Pit are back with a stronger mentality and developed sound, and <em>Kindred</em> reflects this growth. And whether you feel an emotional connection to the grand scale electro pop or you really understand that place described in the lyrics, or maybe you just like to dance around your room with the songs at full blast, as Angelakos says, &#8220;this is a record for everyone.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Marta Jakubowski is one to watch. After her acclaimed graduate collection titled </em>MAMA<em> in 2014 that saw the collection&#8217;s garments connected to each other through fabric trains, Marta exhibited her AW15 range as part of BFC&#8217;s Newgen sponsorship in London and Paris. Having interned at Hussein Chalayan, Alexander Wang, Jonathan Saunders and Bruno Pieters, Marta&#8217;s signature look is bold yet placid and nods to the minimalist aesthetic popular during the early nineties. We are seeing roll necks, cutouts and elongated limbs in block colours of white, reds and black. Pigeons &amp; Peacocks sat down with the Polish born German raised designer to talk about her installations, keeping it real and bringing subtlety back into fashion.</em></p>
<p><strong>P&amp;P: When did you decide to start your own label?</strong></p>
<p>Marta: It wasn&#8217;t really the plan. I found what happened during my MA exciting — creating all this atmosphere, your woman and your own signature. I got picked for “One To Watch” by the British Fashion Council and did a little installation at Somerset House in September. I never decided I&#8217;m going to start my own brand. It was with the sponsorship they offered me through Newgen. You don&#8217;t usually start this coming straight from college, you have to have stockists and done business for a little bit but I really wanted to meet the panel. Then I started to do a new collection and presented it in an installation which was an incredible experience. SS15 was still my MA collection so this is a small collection which I did for AW15 just now. It was my aim to transfer all of that aesthetic into an actual collection girls want to buy and wear.</p>
<p><strong><a ref="magnificPopup" href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/04/Marta-Jakubowski-AW15-4.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8767" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/04/Marta-Jakubowski-AW15-4.jpeg" alt="a model wearing a black long dress with roll neck and long sleeves and cutout on the thighs from Newgen sponsorship winner Marta Jakubowski's autumn winter 2015 collection" width="458" height="640" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/04/Marta-Jakubowski-AW15-4.jpeg 458w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/04/Marta-Jakubowski-AW15-4-310x433.jpeg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/04/Marta-Jakubowski-AW15-4-300x419.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>P&amp;P: How do you create your installations?</strong></p>
<p>Marta: It&#8217;s always really spontaneous. At fashion week, when I had my wearable collection, I did this installation piece called <em>The Bleeding Heart</em>. The idea came up just before the show. The installation didn&#8217;t work out as it was supposed to and the night before I had this garment hanging there and it was not what I wanted to show. The installation was for five days and there was ink within the dress which was all connected so it was constantly bleeding and dripping. It was all the same ink, but through the light, the colour really changed and it got bigger. In the end, my flatmate came to put some things on. I really liked seeing how this whole thing came together without being in control of it. That&#8217;s what I really enjoy, the surprise about it.</p>
<p><strong>P&amp;P: How did people respond?</strong></p>
<p>Marta: They didn&#8217;t even realise that there was anything moving. Everything is so fast in fashion. People come in blocks and they&#8217;re taking pictures of something, they don&#8217;t really know the whole process. Sometimes I feel you have to write so many things down before they actually take time to look at things properly. I think people don&#8217;t really spend time on it. They post something on the internet, everything goes so fast, they&#8217;re not making an effort to come back the next day to see if things have changed. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m missing: people observing things, taking time for things. With this collection I only had eight looks. I kicked some out. It was really important not to overdo things and do the things I thought were important and translated to the best point.</p>
<p><strong><a ref="magnificPopup" href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/04/Marta-Jakubowski-AW15-3.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8766" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/04/Marta-Jakubowski-AW15-3.jpeg" alt="a model wearing a red roll neck with long sleeves and red wide trousers from Newgen sponsorship winner Marta Jakubowski's autumn winter 2015 collection" width="458" height="640" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/04/Marta-Jakubowski-AW15-3.jpeg 458w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/04/Marta-Jakubowski-AW15-3-310x433.jpeg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/04/Marta-Jakubowski-AW15-3-300x419.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>P&amp;P: Which fashion designers inspire you?</strong></p>
<p>Marta: There are a few designers I&#8217;m always looking up to, or I appreciate their work in the nineties a lot. Brands change, obviously — Maison Martin Margiela is not Maison Martin Margiela anymore. Chalayan, Martin Margiela and Helmut Lang always made things which I found so fascinating. It&#8217;s really minimal and it&#8217;s this aesthetic which makes me really emotional, when looking at their early work or even their presentation. It is so simple but so on point. I think fashion kind of lost this a little bit. It&#8217;s not about subtle feeling anymore.</p>
<p><strong>P&amp;P: Maybe it moves in waves so it might come back?</strong></p>
<p>Marta: Hopefully. I feel that right now everything has to be really loud, especially as a young designer who starts their own brand. It&#8217;s a bit like X Factor. Sometimes you compare yourself to the others but then I try to always remind myself that the brands that have really inspired me didn&#8217;t become successful over night, it took them years. I want to keep my aesthetic and make this company grow slowly, like a house I&#8217;m building. These days, especially when you start as a young singer, someone always tells you what to do. I think loads of brands want to listen to the buyers. But as you said, everything happens in waves. Maybe there&#8217;s a desire for something which grows slowly soon, something a bit more underground.</p>
<p><strong><a ref="magnificPopup" href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/04/Marta-Jakubowski-AW15-2.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8765" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/04/Marta-Jakubowski-AW15-2.jpeg" alt="a model wearing a black roll neck with cutout above right breast and black wide trousers that cover the feet from Newgen sponsorship winner Marta Jakubowski's autumn winter 2015 collection" width="458" height="640" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/04/Marta-Jakubowski-AW15-2.jpeg 458w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/04/Marta-Jakubowski-AW15-2-310x433.jpeg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2015/04/Marta-Jakubowski-AW15-2-300x419.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>P&amp;P: Who&#8217;s the woman you&#8217;re designing for?</strong></p>
<p>Marta: I always look at myself and what I would buy and love or what my friends who are really close to me and share the same aesthetic would buy. You always have this woman in mind, it&#8217;s just hard to give her a name. She&#8217;s not this pop star or she&#8217;s not this actress but I know who she is. I just hope she exists. I really want girls to wear my clothes. I want to wear my own collection as well.</p>
<p><strong>P&amp;P: What kind of clothes do you wear yourself?</strong></p>
<p>Marta: I love going vintage shopping because you find pieces you might have had yourself or that remind you of something. You have the guarantee that it&#8217;s still in good shape and it will be for the next 20 years. For me it&#8217;s all about memories. Some of the shoes I have, I&#8217;ve had since I was 16 and I just bleach them again, maybe paint over them or strip them. My Adidas t-shirt, I can wash and wash and wash it. When I was in college and saw how much time it takes to make a nice garment, I thought I can&#8217;t just shop anymore. I bought a coat the other day, it&#8217;s actually a Margiela coat which was really cheap for what it was but I went to the shop about three times and it&#8217;s the only piece I bought in a long time. I also wear my toiles, it&#8217;s the first sample you cut, sometimes out of really different fabrics.</p>

<p><strong>P&amp;P: Why are you interested in memory, from a philosophical point of view?</strong></p>
<p>Marta: Memories make you comfortable with things. I find myself wearing older clothes or dressing myself in the same style as my Mum used to dress and she would always have this constant aesthetic about her clothes for years. She would never follow a trend, it would always be her aesthetic, her own style, she made things more hers. That&#8217;s what I think my woman should be about as well, it&#8217;s the clothes that should define her rather than wearing a costume or this brand. She&#8217;s not a woman who wears a Prada coat because it&#8217;s recognisably Prada.</p>
<p><strong>P&amp;P: How would you feel if the woman who wears your clothes alters them?</strong></p>
<p>Marta: I would love it. For this season, I didn&#8217;t even put labels in. I used my stamp on some of the things. I want it to be washed away so it belongs to the customer. They&#8217;re not just “my” garments, it&#8217;s the customer&#8217;s garment and I&#8217;m still thinking about how the customer can make it his own thing, rather than wearing a brand.</p>
<p><strong>P&amp;P: What&#8217;s on your playlist?</strong></p>
<p>Marta: I love <a href="http://www.vevo.com/watch/jay-z/I-Know/USUV70800295">Jay-Z</a>. I&#8217;ve loved his music since I was a kid. Then I love <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sKzMEQ6MUo">Nico</a>, she&#8217;s also the kind of woman I design for. I love her aesthetic and her whole look, how timeless she is. She had such a strong voice and was such a sensitive person. Hip hop is probably the music I got in touch with first when I was a kid. In college, when you were really stressed or really sad, you don&#8217;t listen to Nico or things which make you a bit more sad, you actually listen to Kanye West and Jay-Z who are like, yeah, you can do it! Hip hop is really strong music. Looking at people like Jay-Z or Kanye and listening to their early stage music and listening to it now, it&#8217;s great. Seeing them struggle and seeing how they are at the top where they don&#8217;t have to worry any more, I think it&#8217;s still real. It&#8217;s just a projection of their time now.</p>

<p>In the past few months, London has entered a state of wild delirium with a mania that is only set to increase – <em>Savage Beauty</em>, the colossal exhibition of late designer Alexander McQueen’s work, opened this month at the Victoria and Albert museum in London. Earlier this year, the fashion industry experienced a similar hysteria with the resurrection of repentant designer John Galliano with his debut couture collection for Maison Margiela, returning to the catwalk after a four-year absence following the outbreak of that video in a Parisian café. These two designers have long fascinated the masses, both within and outwith the fashion industry, and this fascination is the subject of writer and journalist Dana Thomas’s new book, <em>Gods and Kings: the Rise and Fall of Alexander McQueen and John Galliano.</em></p>
<p>“I wanted to honour their work, their passion and their talent. I see them as equivalents to Matisse and Picasso of the fashion industry. They were great men and we were so lucky to witness their extraordinary vision. I wanted this to be a memoir of what it was like to cover this magical moment in fashion,” says Thomas as we sit in a cosy back room of Hazlitt’s hotel in Soho drinking Earl Grey tea. For someone who has written extensively about the fashion industry throughout her career, Thomas is surprisingly and pleasantly non-‘Fashion’ in a dark fleece and Mom jeans and a lilting American accent.</p>
<p>Having previously written a book called <em>Deluxe</em>, which focused on the impact of globalisation on fashion business, Thomas now focuses on the effect such a phenomenon has had on designers’ creativity. She had been writing a story for the <em>Washington Post</em> just after Galliano had been fired from Dior and the similar stories of Christophe Decarnin at Balmain, Marc Jacobs’s multiple rehab stays, Tom Ford’s depression after leaving Gucci and Alexander McQueen’s suicide called attention. “I thought, ‘Wow, there’s definitely something going on here.’ There’s more than just one situation of a guy having a really hard time and a bad addiction.” <em>Gods and Kings</em> became a four-year labour of love, with Thomas speaking to nearly 200 friends, acquaintances and associates of both McQueen and Galliano, as well as sifting through 30 years worth of clips from the British Library and 25 years of notebooks, show invitations and press kits. “I researched this. It’s two full books – one on Galliano and one on McQueen. I’ve had to cut two thirds of the book to get what you have today.”</p>
<p>With such thorough research, you can understand her consternation at respected fashion commentator <a title="Colin's Column The Dark Side of Fashion" href="http://www.businessoffashion.com/2015/02/colins-column-mcqueen-galliano-dark-side-fashion.html">Colin McDowell’s review for <em>The Business of Fashion</em></a>, in which he comments on the “slick but shallow approach” in the writing and research. “I do have the Director’s Cut. I can give you the <em>Full Monty</em> version of the book if you like. I like Colin. I think he is a very good critic and a brilliant writer,” says Thomas, rather diplomatically.</p>
<p>I was rather apprehensive about approaching the subject of the response to the book in the British media. Alexander Fury, the fashion editor of The Independent, called it a <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/gods-and-kings-by-dana-thomas-book-review-exposing-the-seams-cruelly-10011203.html">“sullying, sneering, muck-smearing book”</a> that “seems determined to undermine not only the legacy of McQueen and Galliano, but the entire fashion world,” while fashion critic Sarah Mower <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/22/gods-and-kings-alexander-mcqueen-john-galliano-dana-thomas-beneath-the-skin-andrew-wilson-brutal-bio">wrote for The Guardian</a> that the book is an “insinuating, brutally non-empathetic [work] calculated to fire hatred for the individuals concerned, and for the fashion industry.” It’s rather scathing stuff, but Thomas has that refreshing American way of dealing with issues head on rather than dancing about them.</p>
<p>“I’ve been slammed somewhat in the British press,” she says within the first five minutes of our meeting. She waves away accusations of lucrativeness in the timing of the book’s release, which falls neatly around the opening of the V&amp;A exhibition and the anniversary of McQueen’s suicide, and explains that she began the book before the original <em>Savage Beauty </em>show opened at the Met museum in New York and that the release was postponed from its original date due to family bereavement. It wasn’t a calculated move, she insists, just coincidence on the calendar.</p>
<p>“The British press have been catty,” she says frankly. “I think the British fashion critics have their knives out for me because I hold up a mirror to them in a way that no-one ever has. I am journalist and I looked at the material objectively. The British fashion core is a really small clique that has been holding those jobs for a long time and they’ve all worked with each other at some point or other. They sit next to each other at fashion shows, they go for Sunday brunch together and they’re each other’s kids’ godparents. They all look out for each other and they don’t like that I’ve said, ‘you know what, most of you were really mean to McQueen for the first four years of his career and you had a period where you hazed Galliano because he wasn’t measuring up to these expectations which you had bestowed upon him.’ I don’t think they like that. It appears they don’t like that and so they’re lashing back at me for calling them out on it.” Thomas says that the book has been well-received in America, however.</p>
<p>Despite the many accusations that the book lacks empathy and that it sensationalises the designers’ proclivity for drugs and drink, Thomas insists that her work came from a place of sympathy and understanding, as well as pity at the pressures placed on both designers at the peak of their apparent success. “As a reporter on the fashion beat, I was barely keeping up with what they were doing. If I couldn’t keep up with it and I was just reporting on it, I can’t imagine what it must have been like to be doing it, even with all the support staff that they had. At the end of the book, I want you to feel really sorry for these two guys who were eaten up by this machine and spit out. It’s supposed to be a very sympathetic look at two sensitive creative souls in a dog-eat-dog world. It’s not supposed to inspire hatred. This is more of a cautionary tale so it doesn’t happen again.”</p>
<p>Thomas’s critics also believe that she took some sense of delight in researching and writing about the two designers’ demise, getting satisfaction from exploring their abuses and breakdowns. “When I was writing the part about McQueen killing himself, I was listening to Bach’s Mass in B Minor and it fell on a section of the music called Crucifixus, which is a heart-breaking piece of music but it felt so appropriate for what I was writing. When I finished, I was crying and I had to go to bed. I don’t know how that’s taking joy in writing about someone else’s demise. There were several times when I was writing the book that I got so depressed that I had to go to bed or after interviews talking about the book and I couldn’t even talk to my husband. It was deeply upsetting.”</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most saddening things for Thomas in writing this book was immersing herself so deeply in the subject matter and tracing the designers’ early promise and subsequent downfall. “I think it’s fair to say that McQueen was never happier than when he was in the backyard of his council house in Tooting Bec with his best friend Simon Ungless, with a dress dummy and a bunch of stuff, making things which were never sold. And I think it’s very fair to say that Galliano was never as happy as those three weeks when he got the backing from the Americans, just enough to make that 18-piece collection out of a single bolt of cheap fabric, when he was just making things out of very little, with his good friends and freely creative without commercial constraints and being completely hands on. Their success was their undoing. What is most devastating about McQueen is that there were signposts along the way. When you see his shows now, knowing his story and reading his interviews – he was telling us the entire time that this was coming and nobody saw it. It’s heart-breaking.”</p>
<p>There hasn’t been any comment from either McQueen’s or Galliano’s people, but Thomas is hopeful that the latter will read the book and that it will act as a tool in his continued rehabilitation. “I hope that John sees things in the book that he didn’t realise and that they help him in his recovery. I spoke to many people that he had worked with and they all said the same thing – they loved John, they said he was great and they all had stories about John being so focused and always looking forward – and I think that’s one of the reasons that John is still with us, because he was always looking forward. He did not see an end, like McQueen did.”</p>
<p>While Colin McDowell wrote in his column that Thomas seems to treat Galliano with a “sneering, dismissive tone” throughout her book, in conversation she seems supportive of his rehabilitation and excited for the potential of his return to fashion with a post at Maison Margiela. She questions why he needs to work for another brand and why he “feels the need to reinterpret someone else’s legacy” when what she would like to see most, and many others as well, is John Galliano’s own couture collection. “Before they had drivers and teams of assistants, McQueen and Galliano were just Lee and John, making things, and that’s how it always should have been. I think Galliano is getting back to that. He is really lucky that he has a second chance. I’ve always felt that John Galliano has a guardian angel – he has even said in the press that if he had continued down that path of meds and drink, had he not had this outburst and been fired from Dior, he would have been dead too. So I think he has a guardian angel and I don’t know if it’s not McQueen saying, ‘don’t end up like me friend.’”</p>
<p><em>Gods and Kings</em> has been a pretty controversial publication. Those who work in fashion have been offended by its portrayal of the industry as an abyss of abuse and exploitation and have damned the book as sensationalist fodder, branding Thomas as a tasteless opportunist in the process. On the other hand, it is a much-researched piece of work that provides some degree of insight to the lives of both Alexander McQueen and John Galliano. Its digestible narrative makes it a good resource for those who perhaps aren’t too familiar with the fashion industry or with these two designers in particular, and whatever comments might be made about the tone, the information has been extensively sourced. Thomas herself isn’t on a crusade to bring down the fashion industry. What her book does highlight, however, is the immense pressure that this industry places on creative talent and the consequences of this intimidation. And whether they are gods, kings, guardian angels or merely men, there’s only so much a person can take.</p>

<p>There is a saying in French, “Reculer a mieux sauter”, which means, “Recoil so as to leap further”. It is the act of taking a step back in order to propel oneself further forward, and is a technique that has taken singer songwriter Laura Welsh from the fall out of a band to releasing her acclaimed debut album this month, working with the amazing John Legend in the States and being featured on the new <em>50 Shades of Grey</em> soundtrack alongside the likes of Beyoncé and Annie Lennox:</p>
<blockquote><p>“That experience of being in a band and it didn’t work out, it was a turning point. I took the time to start again and trust my instincts of what I wanted to do musically and creatively. I was in a position where I had the freedom to write what I love.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The resulting album <em>Soft Control</em> has “been a long time in the making,” says Welsh when we meet at Charlotte Street Hotel. She has a fantastic blunt fringe that she sometimes shakes in front of her eyes and a quiet voice that belies her powerful vocals.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I’ve been working on it for a couple of years so I’m definitely ready. I just set out to make a record that I loved and was proud of. It’s an honest album, lyrically – there are songs that came out of a period when I wasn’t in the best place. There were a couple of significant relationships that had fallen apart and I didn’t know where I was going. But sometimes things need to come to an end so you can begin a new chapter – it’s scary but looking back, it was the best thing that could have happened. I feel like when you’re writing an album, it’s a snippet of where you’re at in your life. This album is the journey back from that difficult place and taking control of what you’re doing.”</p></blockquote>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oZ-LOQYYphk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><em>Soft Control</em> is a mixture of dark electro-pop bounced off slightly more raw songs, all with the smoky, sexy quality in Welsh’s voice, which makes it irresistible listening. She’s achieved something that few can do and written an album that you can listen to in any mood and it connects.</p>
<p>When the band that Welsh was in broke up a couple of years ago, she began putting up demos of her songs on Tumblr and one song in particular, <em>Ghost</em>, garnered a lot of attention from record labels and she eventually signed with Outsiders/Polydor, the same label as Lady Gaga, Madonna and Will.i.am. The deal took her to LA, where she worked with multi-award winning singer songwriter John Legend:</p>
<blockquote><p>“John is so insanely talented. We went into the studio late at night and sat around the piano and we wrote The Hardest Part in about four hours. His approach to writing is really honest. I went back to the hotel room after that session and listened to the demo and was like, ‘Wow, so that actually just happened!’”</p></blockquote>
<p>But Welsh’s song writing abilities come as no surprise. Growing up in a musical family in Staffordshire, her vocal abilities were discovered when she was ten years old, singing at gigs with her mother, a fellow musician. She then went on to study music in Birmingham, “where I realised I wanted to be a writer,” and completed her final year at Access to Music in London. But she insists, “I love the song-writing process but it’s still a mystery to me.” That mystery, however, is her therapy.</p>
<blockquote><p> “I find it difficult to have conversations about how I’m really feeling, even with family and friends. I tend to hold it in. But when I’m writing, there’s no filter there. It’s what I need to do as a release. I don’t really think about it too much and I guess my emotions are able to come to the forefront. For me, I always just wanted to make sure that what I was writing came from an honest place. As an outlet, it’s important for me to keep writing.”</p></blockquote>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lpp55Iyq4L0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Welsh also finds a freedom in performing her music, despite her more reserved and shy nature: “It’s liberating to be on stage. It’s a moment when you feel like you can do whatever the hell you want to do. When you perform, you have this switch that allows to be free from everyday life and who you are. Again, it’s a release.” Throughout 2013, she supported Ellie Goulding and London Grammar, while last year she did the festival circuit – Glastonbury, Reading and Leeds – with the popular garage duo Gorgon City, where “the crowds were insane.”</p>
<p>But more than the big shows, Welsh likes the smaller sets and is currently embarking upon a series of album preview performances:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I did an acoustic set in New York, which was amazing. The stripped back shows are more intimidating – it’s just your voice and the keys and it’s more nerve-wracking. I also was in LA in January to do a Guildhall songwriters event and it was me, three strong players and a keys player and it was just incredible. And I just did the Servant’s Jazz Quarters in Dalston and it’s so cool. We’ve got a lot of history in these small venues around London.”</p></blockquote>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CEpo17xhsOM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>For now, London is home, though with shows and tours, Welsh is often living out a suitcase:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I love travelling and seeing new places. I’ve just been to San Francisco for the first time. It’s somewhere that I’ve always wanted to visit and to get to go there through my music is really, really cool.”</p></blockquote>
<p>There is a wonderful positivity about Laura Welsh. When her band and expectations fell apart, she channelled that into her writing and creativity and is now receiving the recognition for her determination and her hard work. She is refreshingly down to earth and unfazed by the momentum of her recent career trajectory. “It’s important to stay on the path that you want to make and just be yourself. So many things can happen when you put out music. I guess you just never know what’s around the corner.” For Laura Welsh, we can only see good things.</p>
