				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Pigeons &amp; Peacocks 9: The Post-Internet Issue is our best magazine yet, and is also editor <a href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/tag/darcy-rive/">Darcy Rive’</a>s last. Here, he says goodbye and thanks all the contributors for making P&amp;P what it is today. </em></p>
<p><em><a href="http://estore.arts.ac.uk/browse/extra_info.asp?compid=1&amp;modid=1&amp;deptid=176&amp;catid=31&amp;prodid=1971">Pigeons &amp; Peacocks 9: The Post-Internet Issue</a> </em>is now out. This real and tangible printed magazine explores the digital and intangible realm of the internet, questioning its influence on fashion, society, relationships and culture. We discover how apps have shaped body image, how data is tracked, how visibility is saving society’s minorities and how new materials are being developed in machines and in petri dishes to push the boundaries of fashion and save our planet. And, of course, the magazine is filled with inspirational and profound images courtesy of the talents of London College of Fashion and our international readership. It is a great issue.</p>
<p>The <em>Post-Internet </em>issue is a great magazine, and it is also my last one as editor. I joined the <em>Pigeons &amp; Peacocks </em>team over three years ago, straight out of Master’s in <a href="http://www.arts.ac.uk/fashion/courses/postgraduate/ma-fashion-journalism/">Fashion Journalism</a>. I had known the magazine from my time studying at LCF, had ripped its pages out of the spine and stuck them to my wall. And then I was lucky enough to join its editorial team.</p>
<p>Throughout my time at the magazine, I have had to privilege to work with some of the most talented, inspiring and hard-working creatives. I have seen stories come to life through the lens of a photographer’s camera, capturing moments in time and holding them forever. I have witnessed stylists create characters in clothing, playing dress up and transcending inanimate garments into living personalities. I have been captivated by the words of writers whose opinions and perspectives have broadened my own. I consider it a great honour to have met and worked with these people, whose vision and skills have the power to change the industry, society and maybe even the world.</p>
<p>I’d like to take the opportunity to thank all our contributors to <em>Pigeons &amp; Peacocks </em>magazine over the last three and half years for making it what it is today. And I’d like to thank all the readers, from all over the globe, for being part of our journey. I am so excited to see the next chapter of <em>P&amp;P </em>and wish the next team and the all coming contributors the very best.</p>

<div id="attachment_15719" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href=" "><img class="size-large wp-image-15719" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/rah_34696520225-470x264.jpg" alt="Image via Sadler's Wells" width="470" height="264" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/rah_34696520225-470x264.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/rah_34696520225-310x174.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/rah_34696520225-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/rah_34696520225-300x169.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/10/rah_34696520225.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Image via Sadler&#8217;s Wells</p></div>
<p>“Thank you, Carlos!” shouted an anonymous audience member in the closing moment of Carlos Acosta’s <em>Classical Farewell</em> at the Royal Albert Hall. This was just ahead of a standing ovation that lasted at least fifteen minutes, if not even longer. Acosta, the Cuban dancer famous the world over as a tour-de-force of ballet, is loved by his audience and has been throughout his extensive two-decade career. Now, as the dancer retires from classical ballet, he rewards his audience one last time with a farewell tour, co-produced by Sadler’s Wells.</p>
<p>The production opens with <em>Winter Dreams</em> (Farewell Pas de Deux), performed by Acosta and Marianela Nunez. It’s a delicate, almost fragile dance, with the heartbreak of parting lovers. In <em>Mayering</em> (Final Pas de Deux), this emotion is intensified and strained with a desperate scene of doomed lovers. Throughout, you could hear a pin drop as the audience lost itself in the tragedy. Acosta returns with Nunez in <em>Don Quixote</em> (Pas de Deux), which in contrast is such a jolly and high-spirited performance, and affords both dancers to showcase their jaw-dropping talents with endless pirouettes and gravity-defying leaps, while in <em>Apollo</em> (Pas de Deux), the choreography is gentle and almost solemn.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <em>Dying Swan</em>, performed by the infallible Sarah Lamb, is the height of beauty and sadness – there is a reason it is one of the most iconic pieces of the ballet choreography. <em>Rhapsody</em> (Pas de Deux) is a fairy tale come to life, with glittering costume and such innocence in the choreography, danced by Yuhui Choe and Valentino Zucchetti. <em>Rubies</em> (Pas de Deux), performed by Lamb and Zucchetti, is charged and shows the technical accomplishment in the dancers. <em>Anadromous</em>, danced by Gabriela Lugo and Luis Valle, is truly spectacular. It reaches something otherworldly in its choreography and reflects a story of survival against adversity.</p>
<p>Though Acosta is retiring from classical ballet, he will continue to perform contemporary dance and direct his dance company Acosta Danza. Audiences can look forward to seeing more of the dancer in the future, but looking back on his career, they can thank him for all he has brought to the stage, to his craft and the world of ballet. Thank you, Acosta.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Internationally acclaimed ballerina Natalia Osipova takes to the Sadler’s Wells stage in a tumultuous triple bill. </em></p>
<p><em><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15613" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/2452.jpg" alt="2452" width="454" height="281" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/2452.jpg 454w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/2452-310x192.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/2452-300x186.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px" /> </em></p>
<p>Ballerina Natalia Osipova has garnered an international reputation as a classical dancer, with famed roles in Swan Lake and Sleeping Beauty. While many would find that sufficient, Osipova is developing her range and creativity by moving into the world of contemporary dance with the help of three bold choreographers.</p>
<p>The first piece, <em>Run Mary Run, </em>is choreographed by Arthur Pita and portrays a much-clichéd narrative of good girl/bad boy and their tragic relationship. Osipova dances opposite Sergei Polunin, dragging him out of the soil to elope for a doomed affair. It’s like <em>Grease</em> with a drugs overdose – a good girl begins dating a bad boy, is corrupted by him through drink and cigarettes, and then he moves onto drugs. The story is tired, the set design plays little role and the lighting is rather poor. Osipova’s dancing, however, is infallible.</p>
<p><em>Qutb</em> is an exceptional piece of work, choreographed by Sadler’s Wells Associate Artist Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui. Further developing his signature style of intimacy and interplay, the second performance shows a polyamorous interdependence of choreography. There is a reliance between the dancers – Osipova, Jason Kittelberger and James O’Hara – which show their absolute trust in each other; and the audience feels as though they are privy to moments of unabashed intimacy. It is an almost sanctified performance.</p>
<p>Russell Maliphant’s choreographed piece <em>Silent Echo </em>shows Oispova opposite Polunin again. There is a really beautiful suspension of their movements and Osipova spins across the stage with such apparent ease. The choreography lacked a sense of cohesion but did allow the ballerina to showcase her abilities efficaciously. Sadly, the dimmed lighting hid a good deal of the talent.</p>
<p>While two of the pieces from the triple bill left the audience in want, Cherkaoui’s piece is a highlight of truly beautiful choreography. Throughout the triple bill, Osipova delivers each move with conviction, precision and passion and that, in itself, is a wonderful thing to behold. And perhaps the most poignant thing about the whole performance set is seeing a respected and reputed creative, challenging and pushing herself into a new way of expression.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.sadlerswells.com/whats-on/2016/natalia-osipova/">Natalia Osipova</a> is at <a href="http://www.sadlerswells.com/">Sadler’s Wells</a> until 1<sup>st</sup> October 2016. </em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Leo Stannard is a dream in every way &#8211; beautiful face, beautiful voice, beautiful songs and all around nice guy.  We catch up with the singer-songwriter to talk about his upcoming album, his tour and his first song about his cat. </em></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-15609" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Leo-High-Res-470x678.jpg" alt="Leo Stannard" width="470" height="678" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Leo-High-Res-470x678.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Leo-High-Res-310x447.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Leo-High-Res-300x433.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Leo-High-Res.jpg 693w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>How would you describe your sound?</em></p>
<p>I suppose on first look I&#8217;m a singer-songwriter but I&#8217;m trying to take that to a whole new place. The raw song will always be the most important thing for me but I’m not scared to experiment in the production as well – a combination of the old and the new.</p>
<p><em>How did you get into song writing?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been writing songs since I was ten years old, so it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve always done. I don&#8217;t know how I got into it – I just always wanted to create stuff. The first song I wrote was about my cat, a classic.</p>
<p><em>What is your song writing process? Do you start with a melody and build up words around it, or do you start with the words and story and then write music to accompany it?</em></p>
<p>I normally get all the melodies in place first and then by that point, I&#8217;m subconsciously singing words with those melodies and that&#8217;s normally a sign of something good. Then I build a concept around that and if it works, I take into the studio. Having a creative structure really helps me.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xDs3Fj-4j9U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><em>Have you been working on an album?</em></p>
<p>I have! I&#8217;ve been working on it since I was 17. The album is the biggest thing for me so I&#8217;m going to make sure it&#8217;s perfect. It&#8217;s going to be a proper journey, not just a random collection of songs.</p>
<p><em>Is it hard to make an album? Did you struggle picking the final song list from all your material?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been planning this since the moment I started to write music so it&#8217;s been a long journey and obviously the song list has evolved massively. I’m writing new songs even now at this late stage of the record, which could feature.</p>
<p><em>You’ve been getting a lot of radio play now – what’s it like to hear yourself on the radio?</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s incredibly humbling. Simple as that. I’m very grateful for some music to be played anywhere.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mrt-UntgdTM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><em>Who are your musical heroes? Have they influenced your own music?</em></p>
<p>A hero for me is Neil Young. He’s definitely influenced me with his pure song writing. I’m constantly listening to Damien Rice, Kendrick Lamar, Claude Debussy, Melody Gardot, Robert Glasper, Snarky Puppy. I&#8217;m not sure if they directly influence the music I write though, I think their drive, fearlessness and creativity is what influences me.</p>
<p><em>London is renowned for its music scene. How has it inspired or developed you as a musician since you moved her?</em></p>
<p>I’m from a very small village near Leicester, and in Ragdale you&#8217;re very much in your own zone, so being in London opens you up to so many more things and that can be very inspiring. You get to mix with people who are in similar positions as you as well, which is great.</p>
<p><em>Where are your favourite music venues and regular haunts?</em></p>
<p>My favourite venue back in Leicester is The Cookie where I&#8217;m actually playing on my UK tour this October. I seem to be spending my time in different places all the time at the moment and in London. My dream is to headline the Royal Albert Hall.</p>
<p><iframe width="1500" height="844" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HlbL6udXmf4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><em>You’ve been touring a lot. What’s your favourite thing about performing live?</em></p>
<p>Just playing the songs and connecting with all the people that have come to watch, it&#8217;s an amazing thing. It&#8217;s kind of like a therapy for me as well – pouring out all that emotion makes me feel so much better.</p>
<p><em>What’s been your most memorable moment from your tour so far?</em></p>
<p>When I played in Brussels with Rudimental – that was a crazy night. There were all the terrorist scares around at that point, so there was talk of pulling the show. But in the end everyone decided to go ahead with it and put fear to one side and it was a big moment.</p>
<p><em>You’re from Leicester and they’ve had a pretty phenomenal time lately – are you a football fan? What do you do to relax from music?</em></p>
<p>I used to play for Leicester Academy but music took over sport when I was younger! Football is a great way of getting away from music for a bit, especially if you&#8217;re a Leicester fan!</p>
<p><em>What else can we expect to see from you in the next year?</em></p>
<p>More music, a whole range of collaborations, again pushing my own boundaries when it comes to sound. I’ve got this UK tour in October and I’m getting more and more into live streaming on socials because there are lots of fans from around the world who I need to connect with.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The Women&#8217;s Equality Party launched their new campaign </em>No Size Fits All <em>during London Fashion Week to change fashion&#8217;s approach to body image.</em></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/12pih5qq4Ojlle/giphy.gif" width="500" height="222" /></p>
<p>London Fashion Week threw up a lot this week &#8211; new trends, See-Now-Buy-Now retail channels, <em><a href="http://www.vogue.co.uk/article/christopher-kane-crocs-trend">*Crocs*</a> </em>and a numerous questions around diversity in fashion or lack thereof.</p>
<p>Model size, healthy and weight were hot topics and the <a href="http://www.womensequality.org.uk/">Women’s Equality Party (WEP)</a> is seized the opportunity to raise issues on body image. The WEP fights for women’s equality in all issues affecting women for the benefit of the entire population. They’re behind the new campaign <a href="http://www.womensequality.org.uk/nosizefitsall"><em>No Size Fits All</em> </a>to draw attention to the “significant and wide-reaching consequences the fashion industry’s idealisation of an extremely thin and uniform body shape.” The campaign is supported by models and ex eating disorder sufferers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/victoriasanusi/womens-equality-party-says-catwalks-should-celebrate-body-di?utm_term=.uxeXxxlw0#.ve1j00owr">Speaking to Buzzfeed,</a> party leader Sophie Walker explained that they are calling for the British Fashion Council to use two different samples sizes, one of which must be a UK size 12 or above. They want the changes to be implemented by LFW 2017 and have written to London mayor Sadiq Khan to withdraw funding from future Fashion Weeks if changes are not made.</p>
<p>Focusing on the proliferation of eating disorders, Walker believes that the ideals promoted across the fashion industry are escalating the issue. “Eating disorders affect 1.6 million people in the UK. Ninety per cent are female.” These conditions are now costing £1.3 billion a year. Walker believes that if fashion designers and UK-based fashion publications promote a greater range of diversity, if women see greater representation, it will promote healthier body ideals and fight against the rise of eating disorders.</p>
<p><em>No Size Fits All </em>joins the likes of <a href="http://www.allwalks.org/">All Walks Beyond The Catwalk</a>, an initiative founded by LCF’s Caryn Franklin, Debra Bourne and model Erin O’Connor, which works with designers and industry leaders to challenge fashion’s promotion of unrealistic body ideals and promote diversity. Hopefully when enough voices call loud enough, the industry will listen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Written and directed by designer Tom Ford, </em>Nocturnal Animals <em>is a gripping and emotional thriller that is sure to be as stylish as it is cinematic.</em></p>

<p>Designer-turned-director Tom Ford floored critics with <em>A Single Man </em>(2009), his directorial debut starring Colin Firth (who won his first Oscar nomination) and Julianne Moore. After a seven-year hiatus from the lens, Ford returns to the silver screen with <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4550098/">Nocturnal Animals</a></em>, an eagerly anticipated romantic thriller starring the likes of Jake Gyllenhal and Amy Adams. Based on Austin Wright’s novel <em>Tony and Susan </em>(1993), Adams plays Susan, a rich, married gallery curator who lifestyle and marriage is a sham. She is sent a manuscript by her ex-husband Edward (Gyllenhal), telling the imagined story of a family trip with their daughter in which they are chased and attacked by three violent aggressors. When the film debuted at the 73<sup>rd</sup> International Venice Film Festival, it received a ten-minute standing ovation and a slew of <a href="http://variety.com/2016/film/reviews/nocturnal-animals-review-venice-film-festival-amy-adams-1201850195/">rave reviews</a>. Audiences will have to wait until 18<sup>th</sup> November for the film to come to selected cinemas, but can satisfy their appetite with the trailer:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Marc Jacobs is no stranger to controversy and now his Spring Summer 2017 collection has been lambasted for its cultural appropriation of dreadlocks. </em></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15493" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-12.24.40.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-09-19 at 12.24.40" width="933" height="597" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-12.24.40.png 933w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-12.24.40-310x198.png 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-12.24.40-768x491.png 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-12.24.40-470x301.png 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-12.24.40-300x192.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 933px) 100vw, 933px" /></p>
<p>Designer Marc Jacobs has never been one to shy away from controversy. It seems to follow him, from <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2270787/Dakota-Fanning-banned-Marc-Jacobs-ad-If-want-read-perfume-bottle-can.html">those adverts with Dakota Fanning</a> to using underage models on the catwalk (the limit is 16 years old, the girls were 14). Once again, Jacobs stands in the eye of the controversy hurricane with his Spring/Summer 2017 collection, which was showcased at New York Fashion Week.</p>
<p>Jacobs brought 90s rave culture to the catwalk with outlandish, saccharine pieces. Sequins here, metallic there and sky-high platforms for all made the collection a magpie’s dream. But unfortunately, few are talking about the collection itself. The focus has largely been on the hairstyle for the show: multi-coloured dreadlocks atop a parade of mostly white models such as Bella Hadid, Kendall Jenner and Karlie Kloss.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15494" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-12.24.58.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-09-19 at 12.24.58" width="932" height="441" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-12.24.58.png 932w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-12.24.58-310x147.png 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-12.24.58-768x363.png 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-12.24.58-470x222.png 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-12.24.58-300x142.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 932px) 100vw, 932px" /></p>
<p>The designer asserts that he was inspired by Lana Wachowski, director, trans-activist and proprietor of a fuchsia-dyed dreadlocked bob, whom he featured in <a href="http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/01/lana-wachowski-marc-jacobs-ads.html">his latest advertising campaign</a>. Boy George has also been mentioned as an influence as well as Harajuku girls from Japan. As yet, no black signifier has been cited as a consideration for the style. Collaborating with iconic hair stylist Guido Palau and a seller on Etsy, <em><a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/DreadlocksbyJena">Dreadlocks by Jenna</a>, </em>the team dyed the locks 300 different shades to match the colours of the collection.</p>
<p>When the images were posted on social media, users were quick to call out cultural appropriation of a traditionally African-American hairstyle. As <a href="http://www.refinery29.uk/2016/09/123415/marc-jacobs-white-models-dreadlocks-nyfw-ss17-photos">Alix Tunell at <em>Refinery 29</em></a> points out, styles such as locks are usually regarded as unappealing – until they are taken in by fashion, put on a white model and suddenly become the most followed trend: “By and large, we as a society have stereotyped dreadlocks as being dirty and unprofessional – unless they’re worn by white women.” Black hair is a battleground and there is growing consciousness around it. Articles such as <em><a href="http://thetab.com/2016/04/05/isnt-ok-white-people-dreadlocks-83996">Why it’s not okay for white people to have dreadlocks</a> </em>are the norm, giving designers and stylists no leeway to call ignorance on the matter. <a href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/2014/10/culture-vultures/">Cultural appropriation</a> must be considered and considered with great sensitivity in this day and age, and fashion cannot exploit it in the name of a new collection or trend.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15495" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-12.25.31.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-09-19 at 12.25.31" width="930" height="600" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-12.25.31.png 930w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-12.25.31-310x200.png 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-12.25.31-768x495.png 768w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-12.25.31-470x303.png 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-19-at-12.25.31-300x194.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px" /></p>
<p>Responding to comments on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BKZfAX5DaYk/">an Instagram photo</a>, the designer wrote: “All who cry ‘cultural appropriation’ or whatever nonsense about any race or skin color wearing their hair in any particular style or manner – funny how you don’t criticize women of color for straightening their hair. I respect and am inspired by people and how they look. I don’t see color or race – I see people. I’m sorry to read that so many people are so narrow minded… Love is the answer. Appreciation of all and inspiration from anywhere is a beautiful thing. Think about it”</p>
<p>His response is as controversial as the dreadlocks themselves, as he calls out beauty ideals that have been perpetrated by Eurocentric ideals of beauty. Jacobs maintains his typically defensive and reckless attitude to the criticisms of his decisions, and those waiting for an apology will be waiting for a very long time. But as we have seen the show and seen the fall out, there is hope that the fashion pack will approach this style with great respect and due consideration. In the words of Jacobs himself, “Think about it.”</p>

<p>Since her inauguration as Prime Minister, Theresa May has had many issues to deal with, least of all <a href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/2016/07/brexit-apocalypse-now/">Brexit</a> and its ramifications for the UK and its industries. With its contribution of £28 billion and 900 000 jobs, the fashion industry is one of the UK economy’s key players, making it one of May’s primary considerations. Showing her support of the industry and upping her already high style credentials (May caused <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/11450145/Theresa-Mays-greatest-footwear-hits.html">a media frenzy</a> with her leopard print pumps), the Prime Minister hosted a reception with the British Fashion Council at 10 Downing Street to open London Fashion Week.</p>
<p>Joined by BFC Chairman Dame Natalie Massenet, the Prime Minister welcomed fashion apprentices and BFC scholarship recipients and graduate trainees to the event, and spoke of her support of these schemes – both within and outwith the fashion industry. May said: “The Government I lead will do everything we can, including the right investment in training and skills, to help everyone, whatever people’s backgrounds, to go as far as their talents can take them.”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister also dealt with the big elephant in the room, whose name is Brexit. “From our home grown start-ups to international fashion houses – every business in the industry will play a major role in ensuring we make a success of Brexit. By taking advantage of the opportunities that leaving the EU gives us and playing to our strengths as a great trading nation – we can build a fairer economy that works for all, not just the privileged few.”</p>
<p>Her sentiments are shared by BFC CEO Caroline Rush, who said recently: “We have a point to prove to our guests that the vote to leave the EU doesn’t mean we’re going to end our international partnerships and collaborations.” Speaking of London Fashion Week and its importance on the international fashion scene, Rush spoke of the anticipation from arriving guests, who are visiting the capital from over 52 countries. “This is the first international event on our shores since the EU vote and it’s definitely sparked a lot of interest from all over the world. People want to know if London feels different. We need to send them a clear message that London is open to outsiders and the UK is a place of business opportunity.”</p>
<p>London mayor Sadiq Khan also expressed his support of London Fashion Week as a platform for international welcome. “London is open to the world and is an international leader of creativity and entrepreneurship. There’s a fantastic range of designers and talent on the schedule this season, highlighting the very best the industry has to offer – from big brands to independent retailers, the London fashion scene has never been more diverse.”</p>
<p>With its economic impact, as well as its draw as a creative force, the UK’s fashion industry is a major issue. But with its priority amongst political figureheads and industry leaders, the forecast looks as bright as the outfits parading around London Fashion Week.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all think our own families are dysfunctional. Few of us understand our parents, fewer are understood by their parents and siblings (if we have them) are both our closest ally and worst enemy. <a href="http://www.lyric.co.uk/whats-on/production/things-i-know-to-be-true/"><em>Things I Know to be True</em></a><em>, </em>written by Andrew Bovell and now playing at the wonderful <a href="http://www.lyric.co.uk/">Lyric Hammersmith</a>, holds an eye to the microscope on the Price family, a typical suburban family, and watches as their lives intertwine and fall apart. It is an intense, invasive and emotional portrayal of a family and it is absolutely amazing.</p>
<div id="attachment_15480" style="width: 482px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class=" wp-image-15480" src="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/THINGS_710X39120V2b-470x259.jpg" alt="Image via Lyric.co.uk" width="472" height="260" srcset="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/THINGS_710X39120V2b-470x259.jpg 470w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/THINGS_710X39120V2b-310x171.jpg 310w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/THINGS_710X39120V2b-300x165.jpg 300w, http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/files/2016/09/THINGS_710X39120V2b.jpg 710w" sizes="(max-width: 472px) 100vw, 472px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Image via Lyric.co.uk</p></div>
<p>Rosie, the youngest daughter played perfectly by Kirsty Oswald, returns to the safety of her family following a disastrous backpacking trip around Europe. She needs to be coddled and finds her solace within the protection of her older siblings and parents. But Pip, performed by Natalie Casey who steals the performance with her heart-wrenching and gut-twisting portrayal of a woman desperate to be loved, is having marriage trouble. Mark, played with great sensitivity by Matthew Barker, has a secret to reveal that rips his relationship with his parents, while Ben, acted by Richard Mylan, has a confession of his own that threatens the relationship between his parents. And reigning over them all is matriarch Fran, played by Imogen Stubbs, a straight-to-the-point and relentless mother, and Bob, who is quite possibly the most Dad of all dads played by Ewan Stewart, who has toiled to give his family everything he never had. These relationships are at once fragile and splintered but unbreakable and ever-lasting. The way they writhe throughout the story is such a precise depiction of family politics; in many ways, it is closer to than bone than many viewers would care for.</p>
<p>The production of this is truly masterful. The whole play is choreographed like some sublime dance, with the smoothest scene changes. Monologues dapple the story as do beautiful dance sequences to the unmistakable soundtrack of composer Nils Frahm. The set grows ever so gradually throughout the scenes until a violent climax and it is spectacular to watch.</p>
<p>When <em>Things I Know to be True </em>finished, the audience rose to its feet and many were crying. The script, story and portrayal on the stage had a poignant resonance and a shared sense of family. It is a formidable play and production, and when you leave, you want to call your parents and all your siblings – no matter how dysfunctional the relationships are.</p>

<p><em>Things I Know to be True is at Lyric Hammersmith until 1st October 2016.</em></p>

<p>Earlier this year, high street giant <a href="http://www.pigeonsandpeacocks.com/2016/05/kenzo-for-hm/">H&amp;M announced</a> that it would be joining forces with fashion favourite Kenzo for its latest designer collaboration. While we have to wait until 3<sup>rd</sup> November for the clothes to hit the stores and online – granted, they’ll only be in stores for a limited number of hours before being snapped up gluttonously by the fashion pack – it has recently been announced that iconic photographer Jean-Paul Goude has shot the campaign, which debuts 17<sup>th</sup> October.</p>

<p>61-year-old model Iman Abdulmajid returns to the camera to join the likes of actresses Chloe Sevigny and Rosario Dawson, composer Riyuchi Sakamoto, rapper Suboi, hip hop artist Chance the Rapper and activist Xiuhtezcatl Martinez in fronting the campaign. Iman revives her role as Kenzo ambassador, having created the legendary campaign for the brand in the early Eighties with photographer Hans Feurer. The imagery also makes use of coloured pictures drawn by Goude in 1972.</p>

<p>“The list of people in the campaign, it’s incredible – people who stand for more than just what meets the eye,” Carol Lim of Kenzo told <em><a href="http://www.vogue.co.uk/article/h-and-m-kenzo-collaboration-chloe-sevigny-iman-carol-lim-interview">Vogue</a></em>. “So having these seven people who represent a span of things in their own lives to us feels really deep and meaningful. That’s what the campaign is about. When you see the collection on a range of our subjects, they look killer. Just wait until you see Iman,” the designer teased. We can’t wait much longer…</p>
