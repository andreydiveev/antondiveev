		<description><![CDATA[Dear Daria

I hope that you were able to get to see the exhibition and that your project is shaping up. I originally was aiming to capture scenes based on the musical styles, showing the diversity of style and music associations. However the photographers involved and the focus become much more on the dress up and fashion led exhibitionist parties because frankly the images were much more appealing visually and were associated more heavily with UAL students and alumni.

I would be happy to discuss the project with you further if you would like and also  to offer advice or help in any way i can with your final year project ideas.

All the best

Antony]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In reply to Roslind

I appreciate your comments and agree with some of your views, however the exhibition was only ever intended to be a snapshot of various parts of London clubland and focused on areas that related to UAL students, Alumni and associated partners. This inevitably lead to certain &#039;scenes&#039; getting more focus than others. 

As much as i would have loved to compile a complete retrospective of all areas of Londons vivid nightlife, 10 years is a lot to deal with and with the resources i had it simply was not possible.

Dont worry im not gutted at all and nor should you be. maybe you would like to get involved in helping to shape the next stage? Please get in touch if so...

All the best

		<description><![CDATA[As much as I have to agree with Rosalind&#039;s comment I am still quite interested as to how this whole phenomenon of documenting clublife and fashion subcultures is to be exhibited.

I am going to come and see to try and gain some inspiration for my final degree project. At the moment the concept is to create a fashion/music &#039;event&#039; (ok, so pretty much a club night) and I wondered what peoples views on this would be? The differences however would be that I would aim to put on bass driven, underground music i.e dubstep, electronica, dnb, dub etc.....usually associated with a more casually dressed streetwear &#039;scene&#039; but a distinctive look all the same.

I think there&#039;s still scope to push the variety of nights that have an emphasis on fashion around London without running the risk of alienating clubbers that don&#039;t typically come across as the exhibitionist sort.

At the end of the day, there&#039;s no denying that the talented photographer&#039;s exhibited here have captured one of the aspects of London that makes this city so great!]]></description>
